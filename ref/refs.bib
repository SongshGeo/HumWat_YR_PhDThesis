However, impacts of hydrological change on social and ecological systems are infrequently evaluated together at the global scale. Here, we focus on the potential for social and ecological impacts from freshwater stress and storage loss. We find basins with existing freshwater stress are drying (losing storage) disproportionately, exacerbating the challenges facing the water stressed versus non-stressed basins of the world. We map the global gradient in social-ecological vulnerability to freshwater stress and storage loss and identify hotspot basins for prioritization (               n               \,=\,168). These most-vulnerable basins encompass over 1.5 billion people, 17\% of global food crop production, 13\% of global gross domestic product, and hundreds of significant wetlands. There are thus substantial social and ecological benefits to reducing vulnerability in hotspot basins, which can be achieved through hydro-diplomacy, social adaptive capacity building, and integrated water resources management practices.},

Agent-based modeling is increasingly used to capture the interaction between individual decision-making and the environment. In this paper, we provide a review of drought risk agent-based models with a focus on behavioral rules. This review leads to the conclusion that human decision rules in existing drought risk agent-based models are often based on ad hoc assumptions without a solid theoretical and empirical foundation. Subsequently, we review behavioral economic and psychological theories to provide a clear overview of theories that can improve the theoretical foundation of smallholder farmer behavior and we review empirical parameterization, calibration, and validation methods of those theories. Based on these reviews, we provide a conceptual framework that can give guidance for the integration of behavioral theories in agent-based models. We conclude with an agenda to guide future research in this field.},

  abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations Agenda 2030 represent an ambitious blueprint to reduce inequalities globally and achieve a sustainable future for all mankind. Meeting the SDGs for water requires an integrated approach to managing and allocating water resources, by involving all actors and stakeholders, and considering how water resources link different sectors of society. To date, water management practice is dominated by technocratic, scenario-based approaches that may work well in the short term but can result in unintended consequences in the long term due to limited accounting of dynamic feedbacks between the natural, technical, and social dimensions of human-water systems. The discipline of sociohydrology has an important role to play in informing policy by developing a generalizable understanding of phenomena that arise from interactions between water and human systems. To explain these phenomena, sociohydrology must address several scientific challenges to strengthen the field and broaden its scope. These include engagement with social scientists to accommodate social heterogeneity, power relations, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases, which strongly influence the way in which people alter, and adapt to, changing hydrological regimes. It also requires development of new methods to formulate and test alternative hypotheses for the explanation of emergent phenomena generated by feedbacks between water and society. Advancing sociohydrology in these ways therefore represents a major contribution toward meeting the targets set by the SDGs, the societal grand challenge of our time. Plain Language Summary Water crises that humanity faces are increasingly connected and are growing in complexity. As such, they require a more integrated approach in managing water resources, which involves all actors and stakeholders and considers how water resources link different sectors of society. Yet, water management practice is still dominated by technocratic approaches, which emphasize technical solutions. While these approaches may work in the short-term, they often result in unintended consequences in the long-term. Sociohydrology is developing a generalizable understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between natural,technical and social processes, which can improve water management practice.

  abstract = {In flood risk assessment, there remains a lack of analytical frameworks capturing the dynamics emerging from two-way feedbacks between physical and social processes, such as adaptation and levee effect. The former, adaptation effect, relates to the observation that the occurrence of more frequent flooding is often associated with decreasing vulnerability. The latter, levee effect, relates to the observation that the non-occurrence of frequent flooding (possibly caused by flood protection structures, e.g. levees) is often associated to increasing vulnerability. As current analytical frameworks do not capture these dynamics, projections of future flood risk are not realistic. In this paper, we develop a new approach whereby the mutual interactions and continuous feedbacks between floods and societies are explicitly accounted for. Moreover, we show an application of this approach by using a socio-hydrological model to simulate the behavior of two main prototypes of societies: green societies, which cope with flooding by resettling out of flood-prone areas; and technological societies, which deal with flooding also by building levees or dikes. This application shows that the proposed approach is able to capture and explain the aforementioned dynamics (i.e. adaptation and levee effect) and therefore contribute to a better understanding of changes in flood risk, within an iterative process of theory development and empirical research.},

We consider two different types of socio-hydrological systems: green systems, whereby societies deal with risk only via non-structural measures, and technological systems, whereby risk is dealt with also by structural measures, such as levees. A stylized model of human-flood interactions is first compared to real-world data collected at two test sites (People's Republic of Bangladesh and the city of Rome, Italy) and then used to explore plausible trajectories of flood risk. The results show that flood risk in technological systems tends to be significantly lower than in green systems. However, technological systems may undergo catastrophic events, which lead to much higher losses. Furthermore, green systems prove to be more resilient than technological ones, which makes them more capable of withstanding environmental and social changes.},

In river basins, changes in sediment transport can have cascading effects that cause ecosystem regime shifts. The Yellow River, once the world's most sediment-rich river, has experienced dramatic regime shifts. Although recent intervention has returned sediment discharge in the Yellow River to pristine levels, our understanding of previous regime shifts remains inadequate, particularly for the regime shift to a sediment rich period during early historical time. We reanalyzed previous datasets to clarify the first historical sediment transport regime shift in the Yellow River. Our results show that while historical climatic changes (e.g., the Medieval Warm Period, about 900-1100 AD) caused changes in sediment transport, a regime shift occurred only under increased forcing from anthropogenic stresses (started from about 1350 AD, reached the tipping point after 1900 AD). This unique behavior of the Yellow River under increasing anthropogenic forces may provide perspective for sustainable river basin management.},

We provide a perspective of processes unfolding over time to identify the regime shifts of a SES based on changes in the relationships between SES components while also addressing their drivers and local and spillover effects. The applicability of this approach has been demonstrated by analyzing the evolution over the past 1000 years of the SES in China's Loess Plateau (LP). Five evolutionary phases were identified: "fast expansion of cultivation," "slow expansion of cultivation," "landscape engineering for higher production," "transition from cultivation to ecological conservation," and "revegetation for environment." Our study establishes empirical links between the state (phase) of a SES to its drivers and effects. Lessons of single-goal driven and locally focused SES management in the LP, which did not consider these links, have important implications to long-term planning and policy formulation of SES.},

Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},

  abstract = {Water stress is often evaluated by scarcity: the share of available water supply being consumed by humans. However, some consumptive uses of water are more or less flexible than others, depending on the costs or effects associated with their curtailment. Here, we estimate the share of global water consumption over the period 1980\textendash 2016 from the relatively inflexible demands of irrigating perennial crops, cooling thermal power plants, storing water in reservoirs and supplying basic water for humans and livestock. We then construct a water stress index that integrates the share of runoff being consumed (scarcity), the share of consumption in these inflexible categories (flexibility) and the historical variability of runoff weighted by storage capacity (variability), and use our index to evaluate the trends in water stress of global major river basins on six continents. We find that the 10\% most stressed basins encompass \textasciitilde 19\%, 19\% and 35\% of global population, thermal electricity generation and irrigated calorie production, respectively, and some of these basins also experience the largest increases in our identified stress indexes over the study period. Water consumption intensities (water used per unit of goods or service produced) vary by orders of magnitude across and within continents, with highly stressed basins in some cases characterized by high water consumption intensities. Our results thus point to targeted water mitigation opportunities (for example, relocating crops and switching cooling technologies) for highly stressed basins.},

  abstract = {The streamflow of major global rivers changes under the influences of climate change and human activities and varies greatly in different regions. TheYellow River has undergone a dramatic shift during the last six decades. Its streamflow gradually dwindled away and even dried-up severely in the late 20th century, but in recent years it has recovered and remains stable. Comprehensive understanding of the river streamflow change and its driving forces promotes effective water resource management within this complex human-natural system. Here, we develop a runoff identity attribution approach to analyze 61 years of streamflow observations from the Yellow River. We find that between the 1950s and the 1980s, human water consumption contributed more than 90\% to streamflow reduction, but from the 1970s onwards, land cover change became the major factor to decrease streamflow. Since 2000, government management schemes have prevented streamflow from declining further and guarantee its stability. Based on the analysis framework we propose, persistent droughts, which are related to abrupt streamflow abatement, may be the most uncontrollable factor in the future. A more resilient management system should be therefore built to grapple with the expected increased frequency of such extreme climate events in the future.},

However, the lack of spatially detailed datasets limits our understanding of the historical water use trend and its key drivers. Here, we present a survey-based reconstruction of China's sectoral water use in 341 prefectures during 1965 to 2013. The data indicate that water use has doubled during the entire study period, yet with a widespread slowdown of the growth rates from 10.66 km               3               {$\cdot$}y               -2               before 1975 to 6.23 km               3               {$\cdot$}y               -2               in 1975 to 1992, and further down to 3.59 km               3               {$\cdot$}y               -2               afterward. These decelerations were attributed to reduced water use intensities of irrigation and industry, which partly offset the increase driven by pronounced socioeconomic development (i.e., economic growth, population growth, and structural transitions) by 55\% in 1975 to 1992 and 83\% after 1992. Adoptions for highly efficient irrigation and industrial water recycling technologies explained most of the observed reduction of water use intensities across China. These findings challenge conventional views about an acceleration in water use in China and highlight the opposing roles of different drivers for water use projections.},

  abstract = {Water scarcity has become a major issue to sustainable development. It can be estimated by available fresh water resources and human water withdrawal, which are affected by both climate change and human activities. However, the key drivers for the changes in water scarcity at global scale remain unclear due to large uncertainties in the estimations of the contributions from changes in water withdrawal and water availability. By using a newly reconstructed water withdrawal dataset and multi-model simulations of water availability, this study assessed global water scarcity evolution during 1971\textendash 2010 at half degree resolution and monthly time scale by applying the water stress index (WSI). Results showed that WSI increased in areas with 61.1\% of global population during 1971\textendash 2010, and the increase in water withdrawal (especially agricultural sector) was the key driving factor for areas with 57.5\% of global population. Specifically, growing water withdrawal led to increased water scarcity for areas with 21\% of global population in spite of rising water availability resulted from climate change, such as in southeastern China, Southeast Asia, southern India, and Central Africa. In contrast, water scarcity mitigated over some developed areas including parts of USA, Europe and Japan with 8.8\% of global population, which resulted from decreased human water withdrawal (especially industrial sector) and increased water availability. This study reveals the synergistic or contrary effects of changes in water withdrawal and water availability on the changes in water scarcity over the globe, and provides useful information for regional water planning and management.},

Population, water availability, and water use are the key elements of these indicators. Most of the progress made in the last few decades has been on the quantification of water availability and use by applying spatially explicit models. However, challenges remain on appropriate incorporation of green water (soil moisture), water quality, environmental flow requirements, globalization, and virtual water trade in water scarcity assessment. Meanwhile, inter- and intra-annual variability of water availability and use also calls for assessing the temporal dimension of water scarcity. It requires concerted efforts of hydrologists, economists, social scientists, and environmental scientists to develop integrated approaches to capture the multi-faceted nature of water scarcity.},

We project an urban surface-water deficit of 1,386\textendash 6,764 million m{$^3$}. More than 27\% of cities studied, containing 233 million people, will have water demands that exceed surface-water availability. An additional 19\% of cities, which are dependent on surface-water transfers, have a high potential for conflict between the urban and agricultural sectors, since both sectors cannot obtain their estimated future water demands. In 80\% of these high-conflict watersheds, improvements in agricultural water-use efficiency could free up enough water for urban use. Investments in improving agricultural water use could thus serve as an important global change adaptation strategy.},

We employ a detailed model of the Willamette River Basin, Oregon, to evaluate the effectiveness of a variety of potential drought policy interventions to conserve or reallocate water during a simulated near-term drought year. The drought year is characterized by early-season low flows that make it impossible to meet water demands. The results indicate that while the policies are effective at conserving water, they have limited ability to mitigate the shortages.},

  abstract = {The freshwater cycle over land is fundamental for sustainability and resilience, yet is extensively modified and shaped by a vast range of human interventions in the land, water, and climate systems. The consequences of human water-cycle modifications can be non-linear, delayed, and distributed across boundaries, sectors, and scale. This complexity renders freshwater challenges difficult to govern and manage. We here propose a framework for understanding water's many functions for supporting, regulating, and stabilizing hydro-climatic, hydro-ecological, and hydro-social systems. This framework recognizes human impacts on major partitioning points, interactions among water functions, and stabilization and destabilization processes. A functional understanding of the freshwater cycle can integrate with social-ecological resilience-building principles, complement existing water sustainability governance approaches, and highlight the potential need for Earth-system-level governance of water. Recognizing water's diverse functional roles for resilience may promote a new generation of holistic and integrative water-land-climate governance.},

Using a framework developed by Turton, and a common set of characteristics describing key stages of water demand, we examine the effectiveness of isolated technical (e.g., irrigation upgrades) and allocative (e.g., buyback) efficiency for reducing water demand to sustainable levels. We base our analysis on Australia's water reform context which offers an advanced example of applying these levers to achieve allocative and technical efficiency. The study is motivated by appreciation of the benefits from increased policy flexibility and adaptability in response to the following: potential transformations toward inflexible production systems; uncertainty associated with impacts of climate change on future water reliability; and the need for increased possible future equity between uses/users (productive/consumptive, environmental, cultural). Our results highlight that a balance between technical and allocative efficiency mechanisms is necessary, as neither is sufficient in isolation, when seeking to reduce total water use. This approach also enables a clearer representation of uncertainty in future policy choices in many global settings with respect to water demand reduction.},

  abstract = {The time is now For decades, scientists have been raising calls for societal changes that will reduce our impacts on nature. Though much conservation has occurred, our natural environment continues to decline under the weight of our consumption. Humanity depends directly on the output of nature; thus, this decline will affect us, just as it does the other species with which we share this world. D\'iaz et al. review the findings of the largest assessment of the state of nature conducted as of yet. They report that the state of nature, and the state of the equitable distribution of nature's support, is in serious decline. Only immediate transformation of global business-as-usual economies and operations will sustain nature as we know it, and us, into the future. Science, this issue p. eaax3100 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDHuman actions have long been known to drive declines in nature, and there is growing awareness of how globalization means that these drivers increasingly act at a distance (telecoupling). However, evidence from different disciplines has largely accumulated in parallel, and the global effects of telecouplings have never been addressed comprehensively. Now, the first integrated global-scale intergovernmental assessment of the status, trends, and future of the links between people and nature provides an unprecedented picture of the extent of our mutual dependence, the breadth and depth of the ongoing and impending crisis, and the interconnectedness among sectors and regions. ADVANCESHuman impacts on life on Earth have increased sharply since the 1970s. The world is increasingly managed to maximize the flow of material contributions from nature to keep up with rising demands for food, energy, timber, and more, with global trade increasing the geographic separation between supply and demand. This unparalleled appropriation of nature is causing the fabric of life on which humanity depends to fray and unravel: Most indicators of the state of nature, whether monitored by natural and social scientists or by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, are declining. These include the number and population size of wild species, the number of local varieties of domesticated species, the distinctness of ecological communities, and the extent and integrity of many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. As a consequence, nature's capacity to provide crucial benefits has also declined, including environmental processes underpinning human health and nonmaterial contributions to human quality of life. The costs are distributed unequally, as are the benefits of an expanding global economy.These trends in nature and its contributions to people are projected to worsen in the coming decades\textemdash unevenly so among different regions\textemdash unless rapid and integrated action is taken to reduce the direct drivers responsible for most change over the past 50 years: land and sea use change, direct harvesting of many plants and animals, climate change (whose impacts are set to accelerate), pollution, and the spread of invasive alien species. Exploratory scenarios suggest that a world with increased regional barriers\textemdash resonating with recent geopolitical trends\textemdash will yield more negative global trends in nature, as well as the greatest disparity in trends across regions, greater than a world with liberal financial markets, and much greater than one that prioritizes and integrates actions toward sustainable development. Evidence from target-seeking scenarios and pathways indicates that a world that achieves many of the global biodiversity targets and sustainability goals related to food, energy, climate, and water is not\textemdash yet\textemdash beyond reach, but that no single action can get us there. OUTLOOKOur comprehensive assessment of status, trends, and possible futures for nature and people suggests that action at the level of direct drivers of nature decline, although necessary, is not sufficient to prevent further deterioration of the fabric of life on Earth. Reversal of recent declines\textemdash and a sustainable global future\textemdash are only possible with urgent transformative change that tackles the root causes: the interconnected economic, sociocultural, demographic, political, institutional, and technological indirect drivers behind the direct drivers. As well as a pan-sectoral approach to conserving and restoring the nature that underpins many goals, this transformation will need innovative governance approaches that are adaptive; inclusive; informed by existing and new evidence; and integrative across systems, jurisdictions, and tools. Although the challenge is formidable, every delay will make the task even harder. Crucially, our analysis pinpoints five priority interventions (``levers'') and eight leverage points for intervention in the indirect drivers of global social and economic systems where they can make the biggest difference. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/366/6471/eaax3100/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Traditional diversity-rich human landscapes, and the livelihoods and identities that depend on them, face global threats.Mosaics of crops, forest, and pasture have been maintained for millennia around the world.

Nature is currently supplying more materials than ever before, but this has come at the high cost of unprecedented global declines in the extent and integrity of ecosystems, distinctness of local ecological communities, abundance and number of wild species, and the number of local domesticated varieties. Such changes reduce vital benefits that people receive from nature and threaten the quality of life of future generations. Both the benefits of an expanding economy and the costs of reducing nature's benefits are unequally distributed. The fabric of life on which we all depend\textemdash nature and its contributions to people\textemdash is unravelling rapidly. Despite the severity of the threats and lack of enough progress in tackling them to date, opportunities exist to change future trajectories through transformative action.

Based on these insights, shifts in sustainable development practice are suggested to recognize and govern the complex and codeveloping social and ecological aspects of development challenges. The potential susceptibility of SES to nonlinear systemic reconfigurations is highlighted, as well as the opportunities, agency, and capacities required to foster reconfigurative transformations for sustainable development. SES research proposes the need for diverse values and beliefs that are more in tune with the deep, dynamic connections between social and ecological systems to transform development practice and to support capacities to deal with shocks and surprises. From these perspectives, SES research offers new outlooks, practices, and novel opportunity spaces from which to address the challenges of the Anthropocene.},

In recent decades, the Yellow River basin is facing a spectacular economic boom, but mainly achieved at the expenses of the environment by over-exploiting the natural resources provided within the basin, which causes various challenges on ecology and society. Water scarcity, pollution, and ecosystem degradation accompanied with biodiversity decline have been further aggravated by anthropogenic-induced climate change. To address the pressing socio-ecological challenges, various conservation and management plans and strategies have been issued, often consulted by international bodies.

Yet, this silt load (loess plateau) has fallen considerably in recent years, but at the cost of other forms of sustainability, such as streamflow. The reasons for this dramatic decline in runoff are complex. In addition to reducing silt load, terraces and vegetation have led to the marked reduction in runoff. The fall in natural runoff can also be attributed to groundwater and mining extractions, as well as reservoir filling. Population per se is not a major driver of water demand compared to irrigated agriculture and other sectors, notably mining and industry. While China is not a federal system, it is organized in a complex hierarchical system where provinces play an important role and are capable of serving their own interests in negotiating usages and allocations of the river.

  abstract = {China's economic growth is expected to continue into the next decades, accompanied by sustained urbanization and industrialization. The associated increase in demand for land, water resources, and rich foods will deepen the challenge of sustainably feeding the population and balancing agricultural and environmental policies. We combine a hydrologic model with an economic model to project China's future food trade patterns and embedded water resources by 2030 and to analyze the effects of targeted irrigation reductions on this system, notably on national agricultural water consumption and food self-sufficiency. We simulate interprovincial and international food trade with a general equilibrium welfare model and a linear programming optimization, and we obtain province-level estimates of commodities' virtual water content with a hydrologic model. We find that reducing irrigated land in regions highly dependent on scarce river flow and nonrenewable groundwater resources, such as Inner Mongolia and the greater Beijing area, can improve the efficiency of agriculture and trade regarding water resources. It can also avoid significant consumption of irrigation water across China (up to 14.8 km               3               /y, reduction by 14\%), while incurring relatively small decreases in national food self-sufficiency (e.g., by 3\% for wheat).

The water footprint, which considers water use in supply chains, provides a powerful tool for assessing the contributions of water resources within a certain region by tracking the volume and structure of virtual water flows. In this study of the structure of the water footprint network from a complexity perspective, we reassessed the significance of water resources for crop services in a large river basin with a severe water shortage \textendash{} the Yellow River basin (YRB) of China. The temporal increase of the complexity index indicated that the virtual water outflows (VWFs) from the YRB were becoming increasingly critical to China; i.e. the ability of YRB to produce crops boosted the difficulty of its water being replaced by water exporting from other basins. Decomposition of complexity suggested that during the 1980s to 2000s, the temporally increased complexity was due mainly to the lack of competitors and the increasing uniqueness of crops supporting VWFs. This complexity deeply embedded the YRB into the footprints of a water network that facilitated further development with constrained water resources. Still, it also reinforced reliance from other regions on YRB's scarce water. Based on this analysis, we suggest that resource regulation should be carried out appropriately to ensure ecological sustainability and high-quality development of river basins.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Sociohydrology was launched as the science dealing with feedbacks between coupled human and water systems. Much of the early work in sociohydrology involved studies in spatially isolated domains (e.g., river basins) dealing with phenomena that involved emergent patterns in the time domain, with a focus on formulating and testing hypotheses about how they arise. The papers collected in this Special Section ``Sociohydrology: Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Coupled Human-Water Systems'' illustrate that the scientific scope of sociohydrology has broadened over the last few years, with a rich diversity of phenomena studied and an expansion of the knowledge foundations and methodologies applied. These Special Section papers now incorporate methodologies and approaches from a wide range of social science disciplines, including anthropology, complex systems, economics, and sociology. The major themes tackled by these papers are understanding (i) water metabolism\textemdash the economic use of water; (ii) interactions between humans and droughts; (iii) interactions between humans and floods; and (iv) the role of human institutions, policy, and management. These collected papers provide a foundation for future research that strives to understand how to achieve water resources sustainability (society to water) and reduce the risk of hydrological hazards in society (water to society). Going forward, we suggest that the development of a common sociohydrology framework will be paramount for research development and student training. Additionally, increased engagement with the broader water management communities will enhance sociohydrology understanding and impact.},

  abstract = {The river Nile flows across 11 African countries, supporting millions of human livelihoods, and holding globally important biodiversity and endemism yet remains underprotected. No basin-wide spatial conservation planning has been attempted to date, and the importance of coordinated conservation planning for the Nile's biodiversity remains unknown. We address these gaps by creating a basin-wide conservation plan for the Nile's freshwater fish. We identify priority areas for conservation action and compare cross-boundary collaboration scenarios for achieving biodiversity conservation targets, accounting for river connectivity. We found that collaborative conservation efforts are crucial for reducing conservation costs, saving 34\% of costs compared to an uncoordinated, business-as-usual scenario. While most Nile basin countries benefit from coordinating conservation planning, costs and benefits are unequally distributed. We identify ``hot spots'' consistently selected as conservation priority areas across all collaboration scenarios, and provide a framework for improving return on conservation investment for large and complex river systems globally. Basin-wide cooperation is crucial for cost-effective conservation of river Nile biodiversity. Basin-wide cooperation is crucial for cost-effective conservation of river Nile biodiversity.},

We used national-level data and a mathematical model to provide an empirical test of the hypothesis that national economies display two distinct economic regimes that are maintained by self-reinforcing feedbacks between natural resources and society. Our results not only support previous findings that two distinct groups exist, but also show that countries move toward one of these two different equilibrium points because of their different patterns of natural resource use and responses to population growth. At the less economically developed equilibrium point maintained by ``green-loop'' feedbacks, human populations depend more directly on ecosystems for income. At the more economically developed equilibrium point maintained by ``red-loop'' feedbacks, nonecosystem services (e.g., technology, manufacturing, services) generate the majority of national gross domestic product (GDP), but increasing consumption of natural resources means that environmental impacts are higher and are often exported (via cross-scale feedbacks) to other countries. Feedbacks between income and population growth are pushing countries farther from sustainability. Our analysis shows that economic growth alone cannot lead to environmental sustainability and that current trajectories of resource use cannot be sustained without breaking feedback loops in national and international economies.},

However, the planetary boundary for human freshwater use has been critiqued as a singular measure that does not reflect all types of human interference with the complex global water cycle and Earth System. We suggest that the water planetary boundary will be more scientifically robust and more useful in decision-making frameworks if it is redesigned to consider more specifically how climate and living ecosystems respond to changes in the different forms of water on Earth: atmospheric water, frozen water, groundwater, soil moisture, and surface water. This paper provides an ambitious scientific road map to define a new water planetary boundary consisting of sub-boundaries that account for a variety of changes to the water cycle.},

However, green water lacks explicit consideration in the existing planetary boundaries framework that demarcates a global safe operating space for humanity. In this Perspective, we propose a green water planetary boundary and estimate its current status. The green water planetary boundary can be represented by the percentage of ice-free land area on which root-zone soil moisture deviates from Holocene variability for any month of the year. Provisional estimates of departures from Holocene-like conditions, alongside evidence of widespread deterioration in Earth system functioning, indicate that the green water planetary boundary is already transgressed. Moving forward, research needs to address and account for the role of root-zone soil moisture for Earth system resilience in view of ecohydrological, hydroclimatic and sociohydrological interactions.},

  abstract = {Water is indispensable for Earth resilience and sustainable development. The capacity of social-ecological systems to deal with shocks, adapting to changing conditions and transforming in situations of crisis are fundamentally dependent on the functions of water to e.g., regulate the Earth's climate, support biomass production, and supply water resources for human societies. However, massive, inter-connected, human interference involving climate forcing, water withdrawal, dam constructions, and land-use change have significantly disturbed these water functions and induced regime shifts in social-ecological systems. In many cases, changes in core water functions have pushed systems beyond tipping points and led to fundamental shifts in system feedback. Examples of such transgressions, where water has played a critical role, are collapse of aquatic systems beyond water quality and quantity thresholds, desertification due to soil and ecosystem degradation, and tropical forest dieback associated with self-amplifying moisture and carbon feedbacks. Here, we aggregate the volumes and flows of water involved in water functions globally, and review the evidence of freshwater related linear collapse and non-linear tipping points in ecological and social systems through the lens of resilience theory. Based on the literature review, we synthesize the role of water in mediating different types of ecosystem regime shifts, and generalize the process by which life support systems are at risk of collapsing due to loss of water functions. We conclude that water plays a fundamental role in providing social-ecological resilience, and suggest that further research is needed to understand how the erosion of water resilience at local and regional scale may potentially interact, cascade, or amplify through the complex, globally hyper-connected networks of the Anthropocene.},

                   adaptive capacities. Beyond geophysical stressors and

                   multi-sector, multi-scale economic teleconnections

                   analysis of potential water scarcity impacts by
                   linking a global human-Earth system model, a global
                   hydrologic model, and a metric for the loss of

  volume =        {107},
  abstract =      {Freshwater resources are fundamental for maintaining
                   human health, agricultural production, economic
                   activity as well as critical ecosystem functions. As
                   populations and economies grow, new constraints on
                   water resources are appearing, raising questions
                   about limits to water availability. Such resource
                   questions are not new. The specter of “peak
                   oil”—a peaking and then decline in oil
                   production—has long been predicted and debated. We
                   present here a detailed assessment and definition of
                   three concepts of “peak water”: peak renewable
                   water, peak nonrenewable water, and peak ecological
                   water. These concepts can help hydrologists, water
                   managers, policy makers, and the public understand
                   and manage different water systems more effectively
                   and sustainably. Peak renewable water applies where
                   flow constraints limit total water availability over
                   time. Peak nonrenewable water is observable in
                   groundwater systems where production rates
                   substantially exceed natural recharge rates and where
                   overpumping or contamination leads to a peak of
                   production followed by a decline, similar to more
                   traditional peak-oil curves. Peak “ecological”
                   water is defined as the point beyond which the total
                   costs of ecological disruptions and damages exceed
                   the total value provided by human use of that water.
                   Despite uncertainties in quantifying many of these
                   costs and benefits in consistent ways, more and more
                   watersheds appear to have already passed the point of
                   peak water. Applying these concepts can help shift
                   the way freshwater resources are managed toward more
                   productive, equitable, efficient, and sustainable
                   use.},

  abstract =      {Large hydrologic basins involve multiple
                   stakeholders, and coupled dynamic social and
                   ecological processes. Managing such basins has long
                   been a challenge. Balancing the demand for water from
                   nature against that from humans is always difficult,
                   particularly in arid watersheds. Here, we analyze
                   potential institutional causes of ecological
                   degradation and how it can be reversed by introducing
                   new forms of governance. The framework and
                   assumptions are illustrated using China's
                   second-largest endorheic basin, where empirical
                   evidence shows that the introduction of a new
                   governing authority connecting midstream and
                   downstream actors facilitated the establishment of a
                   new governance regime that is better aligned with the
                   biophysical scales of the watershed. A trans-regional
                   water allocation project initiated by the new
                   higher-level authority successfully rescued
                   downstream oases and restored a dried terminal lake.
                   These outcomes suggest that when social and
                   ecological structures are better aligned our ability
                   to manage the interplay between social and ecological
                   processes increases. However, the lack of direct
                   connection between the actors of the middle and lower
                   reaches resulted in the paradox of an increase in
                   water demand. We therefore suggest that measures to
                   stimulate the emergence of horizontal social ties
                   linking different critical groups of actors across
                   the watershed could further the alignment of the
                   institutional and biophysical structures-without
                   these changes sustainable management of river basins
                   and other common pool resources will remain
                   problematic. (C) 2019 Science China Press. Published

  volume =        {49},
  abstract =      {Many large-scale water resources systems, especially
                   in transboundary contexts, are characterized by the
                   presence of several and conflicting interests and
                   managed by multiple, institutionally independent
                   decision makers. These systems are often studied
                   adopting a centralized approach based on the
                   assumption of full cooperation and information
                   exchange among the involved parties. Such a
                   perspective is conceptually interesting to quantify
                   the best achievable performance but might have little
                   practical impact given the real political and
                   institutional setting. In this work, we propose a
                   novel decision-analytic framework based on multiagent
                   systems to model and analyze different levels of
                   cooperation and information exchange among multiple
                   decision makers. The Zambezi River basin is used as a
                   case study. According to the proposed agent-based
                   optimization approach, each agent represents a
                   decision maker, whose decisions are defined by an
                   explicit optimization problem considering only the
                   agent's local interests. The economic value of
                   information exchange is estimated comparing a
                   noncooperative setting, where agents act
                   independently, with the first basic level of
                   cooperation, i.e., coordination, characterized by
                   full information exchange. The economic value of
                   cooperation is also estimated by comparison with the
                   ideal, fully cooperative management of the system.
                   Results show that coordination, obtained with
                   complete information exchange, allows the downstream
                   agents to better adapt to the upstream behaviors. The
                   impact of information exchange depends on the
                   objective considered, and we show coordination to be
                   particularly beneficial to environmental interests.},

                   compounded by conflict-induced population shocks.
                   Integrating knowledge across hydrology, climatology,
                   agriculture, political science, geography, and
                   economics, we present the Jordan Water Model, a
                   nationwide coupled human–natural-engineered systems
                   model that is used to evaluate Jordan’s freshwater
                   security under climate and socioeconomic changes. The
                   complex systems model simulates the trajectory of
                   Jordan’s water system, representing dynamic
                   interactions between a hierarchy of actors and the
                   natural and engineered water environment. A

                   the evaluation of both systemwide and distributional
                   outcomes translated into a suite of water-security
                   metrics (vulnerability, equity, shortage duration,
                   and economic well-being). Model results indicate
                   severe, potentially destabilizing, declines in
                   freshwater security. Per capita water availability
                   decreases by approximately 50\% by the end of the
                   century. Without intervening measures, {$>$}90\% of
                   the low-income household population experiences
                   critical insecurity by the end of the century,

                   prevalent across narratives. To gain a foothold on

                   exogenous shocks. While resilience and robustness are
                   relatively easily defined, their empirical assessment

                   governance requires collaboration. However, studies
                   have shown that various types of stakeholders often
                   lack the willingness to deliberate and contribute to
                   jointly negotiated solutions to common environmental
                   problems. Bodin reviews studies and cases that
                   elucidate when, if, and how collaboration can be
                   effective and what kind of environmental problems are
                   most fruitfully addressed in this way. The piece
                   provides general conclusions about the benefits and
                   constraints of collaborative approaches to
                   environmental management and governance and points

                   BACKGROUNDCurrent and future generations are
                   confronted with the complex task of devising
                   sustainable solutions to environmental problems. The
                   coming decade might determine whether humanity will
                   be able to set a course toward a future of continued
                   prosperity on a planet whose ecosystems will deliver
                   the needed goods and services. A crucial piece of
                   this puzzle is achieving effective collaboration
                   among different public and private actors and
                   stakeholders. Calls for solving environmental
                   problems through collaborative governance emphasize
                   benefits from local to global scales—from artisanal
                   fishermen avoiding the overfishing of local fish
                   stocks by together agreeing upon sustainable
                   practices, to states jointly committing to implement
                   adequate measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
                   Although commonly advocated, achieving successful
                   collaborations when confronted with complex
                   environmental problems spanning geographical scales
                   and jurisdictional boundaries is an area where
                   substantial knowledge gaps remain. ADVANCESA growing
                   amount of empirical evidence shows the effectiveness
                   of actors engaged in different collaborative
                   governance arrangements in addressing environmental
                   problems. However, studies also show that actors
                   sometimes collaborate only as a means of advocating
                   their own interests, while largely lacking a
                   willingness to contribute towards jointly negotiated
                   solutions to common problems. Hence, collaboration is
                   sometimes unable to deliver any tangible outcomes, or
                   merely produces symbolic outcomes such as aggregated
                   wish lists where conflicts of interest are left
                   untouched.Clearly, no single blueprint exists for how
                   to succeed by using collaborative approaches to solve
                   environmental problems. One way of approaching this
                   puzzle is through the lenses of the participating
                   actors and the ways in which they engage in
                   collaboration with each other. This approach entails
                   directing attention to who the actors are, what their
                   interests and motives are, who they collaborate with,
                   and how the structures of such “collaborative
                   networks” relate to the actors’ joint abilities
                   to address different environmental problems.Emerging
                   insights from recent research suggest that the
                   effectiveness of different collaborative network
                   structures in addressing environmental problems
                   depends on how those problems unfold with respect to
                   the following characteristics: (i) varying levels of
                   risk that actors free-ride on others’ efforts; (ii)
                   varying levels of knowledge gaps, signifying
                   different needs for social learning and deliberation
                   among actors with different backgrounds, experiences,
                   and interests; and (iii) whether these problems are,
                   for all practical purposes, permanent or just
                   temporary.Also, long-standing research questions
                   regarding whether governance structures that are
                   adequately aligned with ecosystem structures and
                   processes are more effective have recently been
                   addressed empirically. Early results suggest several
                   ways in which misalignments between the structure of
                   a collaborative network and the biophysical
                   environment reduce the ability to address
                   environmental problems effectively. OUTLOOKA more
                   nuanced understanding of whether collaborative
                   governance is the most effective way of solving
                   environmental problems is needed. The capacity of
                   collaborative governance to deliver sustainable
                   solutions for any given environmental problem ranges
                   from highly effective to essentially worthless.
                   Future efforts must establish which factors determine
                   the exact location of any collaborative arrangement
                   on this continuum.Emerging insights suggest that
                   where a collaborative arrangement falls on the
                   spectrum results from a complex interplay between
                   several factors. The characteristics of the
                   underlying collective action problem are one factor.
                   Others are the characteristics of the underlying
                   biophysical system and how these align with the ways
                   in which collaborative governance arrangements are
                   constructed, institutionally embedded, and managed.
                   Finally, the patterns in which actors collaborate
                   with each other (or do not) is a factor that
                   potentially determines the effects that the other
                   factors have on a collaborative arrangement’s
                   ability to solve environmental problems. {$<$}img

  ecosystems is challenging because of the high number of stakeholders, the
  permeability of man-made political and jurisdictional demarcations in
  relation to the temporal and spatial extent of biophysical processes, and a
  limited understanding of complex ecosystem and societal dynamics. Given these
  conditions, collaborative governance is commonly put forward as the preferred
  means of addressing environmental problems. Under this paradigm, a deeper
  understanding of if, when, and how collaboration is effective, and when other
  means of addressing environmental problems are better suited, is needed.
  Interdisciplinary research on collaborative networks demonstrates that which
  actors get involved, with whom they collaborate, and in what ways they are
  tied to the structures of the ecosystems have profound implications on
  actors’ abilities to address different types of environmental problems.},

                   humans and nature is crucial for developing
                   strategies to effectively manage natural resources
                   and to enhance resilience of social–ecological
                   systems (SES). Network analysis bears great potential
                   to advance such comprehension of SESs because it
                   allows for identifying and analysing direct and

                   the number of network studies in social–ecological

                   network studies exploring a wide range of phenomena
                   at the human–nature interface was conducted,
                   resulting in 138 studies falling into three proposed
                   categories. We examine their network
                   conceptualization and means of analysis, and discuss
                   challenges and potentials of each of the three
                   categories in empirical research. The study
                   highlights the diversity and creativity with which
                   distinct social and ecological entities are defined
                   to enable the use of a variety of network analytical

                   scholarship on the commons, the paper pursues two
                   strategies of critique. The first strategy of
                   friendly critique accepts the basic assumptions of
                   most writings on common property to show that
                   scholars of commons have discovered far more
                   variables that potentially affect resource management
                   than is possible to analyze carefully. The paper
                   identifies some potential means to address the
                   problem of too many variables. The second line of
                   critique proceeds differently. It asks how analyses
                   of common property might change, and what they need
                   to consider, if they loosen assumptions about
                   sovereign selves and apolitical property rights

                   will self-organize and sustainably govern resources

                   identify three general types of fit: namely,

                   system fit. Each of these draws attention to
                   different dimensions of social–ecological systems,
                   with their own unique set of evaluative criteria.

                   as a threat to causal claims in management research
                   and note that practices for addressing endogeneity in

                   micro researchers understand fundamental endogeneity
                   concepts by: (1) defining a typology of four distinct
                   causes of endogeneity, (2) summarizing endogeneity
                   causes and methods used in management research, (3)
                   organizing the expansive methodological literature by
                   matching the various methods to address endogeneity
                   to the appropriate resources, and (4) setting an

  abstract =      {Basin water allocation is the core of water resources
                   management in the Yellow River Basin. By applying the
                   bankruptcy theory and water resources bankruptcy
                   allocation rules, this study analyzed the water
                   resources allocation and re- allocations in the
                   Yellow River Basin under four scenarios, including
                   the 1987 water resources allocation; water resources
                   re-allocations under changes in natural water
                   resources and sedimentation; water resources
                   allocations under Yellow River ecological protection
                   and high-quality development strategy; and water
                   resources allocations under the implementation of the
                   West Route of South- to- North Water Transfer
                   Project. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The
                   examination of the 1987 water resources allocation
                   revealed that the allocations are more close to the
                   sequential sharing rules- proportional rule (SSRs-
                   PRO) bankruptcy rule, indicating a combination of
                   provincial geographical location and
                   upstreamdownstream coordination. (2) The analysis in
                   view of the current situation of economic and social
                   development, ecological environment, and water and
                   sediment relationship in the basin showed that the
                   basin is facing bankruptcy distribution again. (3)
                   Under ecological protection and highquality
                   development strategy in the river basin, the
                   re-allocation analysis incorporating agricultural
                   water use efficiency indicated that the provinces
                   with high water productivity, including Shandong,
                   Henan, and Sichuan Provinces, will enjoy increased
                   allocation under all bankruptcy rules; while Shanxi,
                   Qinghai, Gansu, and Ningxia, where water productivity
                   is low, will have decreased allocation. (4) The
                   comparison between diversion scales of 5, 9, and 17
                   billion m3 of the West Route of South-to-North Water
                   Transfer Project showed that 9 billion m3 division
                   and application of SSRs-PRO of the“Yellow River
                   Water Allocation Scheme in 1987”is a reasonable
                   choice for the Yellow River Basin. Applying
                   bankruptcy theory to the Yellow River Basin provides
                   a new perspective for water resources allocation and
                   re-allocation in the basin.},

                   are important factors leading to the break of the
                   Yellow River, but it should not be exaggerated. The
                   direct cause of the break of the Yellow River is the
                   increase of water consumption in the basin, but the
                   root cause is the poor management and improper
                   allocation of water resources in the basin. From the
                   relevant data, it can be seen that 1997, 2000 and
                   2001 were the years when the inflow was greatly
                   reduced. In 1997, the flow was cut off for 228 days,
                   while in 2000 and 2001, the Yellow River did not cut
                   off. It can be seen that human beings can do

                   background，research process and continuous
                   development of the Yellow River water allocation
                   scheme in 1987 ( Scheme 1987 in short) ，and
                   analyzed the implement processes and effects of the
                   two periods before and after the integrated water
                   regulation in 1999. The new challenges and solutions
                   of the water resources under changing environment in
                   the basin were proposed. Scheme 1987 is the first
                   basin-scale water allocation scheme for large rivers
                   in China. It has great breakthroughs and
                   demonstration signifi- cance for China to promote the
                   scientific allocation and efficient use of water
                   resources. Scheme 1987 has been continuously
                   refined，deep- ened，developed and improved by
                   series of work such as refinement among tributaries
                   and regions，improvement of the water allocation
                   scheme under the new runoff conditions and the
                   formulation of the red line for water consumption
                   control，which strongly supports the water resources
                   management of the Yellow River basin and constitutes
                   an important watershed management technical
                   documentation. In the past 30 years，Scheme 1987 and
                   the Yellow River water resources management practice
                   have effectively restrained the water demand growth
                   of the ba- sin，coordinated the water use relations
                   of the 11 provinces and regions along the
                   river，supported the sustainable socioeconomic
                   development of the basin and the maintenance of the
                   ecological environment，and realized the mainstream
                   continuous flowing for 20 consecutive years. In the
                   future，the demand for water resources in the Yellow
                   River basin will continue to show a certain rigid
                   growth. The key issue of water re- sources management
                   in the basin is how to alleviate the constraints of
                   water resources on socioeconomic development of the
                   basin，and support the benign maintenance of the
                   ecological environment.},

                   is related to river health, human water relationship,
                   regional coordinated development, and security and
                   stability of societies. Water distribution of the
                   Yellow River is one of the major difficulties faced
                   in the implementation of the Yellow River national
                   strategy, which is related to the national economy
                   and people’s livelihood. At present, there are many
                   studies on transboundary river water distribution in
                   China and internationally, but accurate and
                   reasonable conclusions have yet to be reached. The
                   1987 water distribution scheme for the Yellow River
                   has been implemented for more than 30 years and
                   changes are urgently needed. In this study, through
                   data collection and analysis of a large amount of
                   literature, the thoughts, principles, and rules of
                   water distribution in transboundary rivers were
                   summarized, and a set of systematic calculation
                   methods of water distribution in transboundary rivers
                   was put forward. This new approach is characterized
                   by multi- method synthesis- dynamic analysis-
                   harmonious water distribution based on the thoughts,
                   principles, and rules of water distribution (SDH
                   method for short). On this basis, the theoretical
                   method was applied and the actual situation of the
                   Yellow River Basin and the results of existing
                   scientific research were fully considered. The
                   results are as follows: (1) Water distribution in
                   transboundary rivers is a difficult problem, which
                   involves the complicated relationships between human
                   and nature and between people; (2) The proposed water
                   distribution method takes into account factors such
                   as current water distribution scheme, current water
                   use, future water demand, population, GDP, river
                   basin area, and the overall optimal distribution,
                   changes year on year with the change of the quantity
                   of distributable water, and meets the minimum water
                   demand and water use efficiency constraints; (3) The
                   1987 water distribution scheme for the Yellow River
                   needs to be adjusted. Considering the change of the
                   total distributable water amount, a new scheme for
                   the Yellow River water distribution under the two
                   scenarios of 37 billion and 30 billion m3 of assumed
                   distributable water is determined respectively (the
                   “19ZQT” water distribution scheme), and the
                   suitability of the scheme was analyzed and
                   demonstrated.},

                   privatisation of resources have been advocated, but
                   neither the state nor the market have been uniformly
                   successful in solving common pool resource problems.
                   Offering a critique of the foundations of policy
                   analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor
                   Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data
                   to explore conditions under which common pool
                   resource problems have been satisfactorily or
                   unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom first describes
                   three models most frequently used as the foundation
                   for recommending state or market solutions. She then
                   outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to
                   these models in order to illustrate the diversity of
                   possible solutions. In the following chapters she
                   uses institutional analysis to examine different ways
                   - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the
                   commons. In contrast to the proposition of the
                   tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems
                   sometimes are solved by voluntary organisations
                   rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases
                   considered are communal tenure in meadows and
                   forests, irrigation communities and other water
                   rights, and fisheries.},

                   research approaches that include the human dimension
                   when studying the natural environment. In spite of
                   the recent development of several conceptual
                   frameworks integrating human society with nature,
                   there has been less methodological and theoretical
                   progress on how to quantitatively study such
                   social–ecological interdependencies. We propose a
                   novel theoretical framework for addressing this gap
                   that partly builds on the rapidly growing
                   interdisciplinary research on complex networks. The
                   framework makes it possible to unpack, define and
                   formalize ways in which societies and nature are
                   interdependent, and to empirically link this to
                   specific governance challenges and opportunities
                   using a range of theories from both the social and
                   natural sciences in an integrated way. At the core of
                   the framework is a set of basic building blocks
                   (motifs) that each represents a simplified but
                   non-trivial social–ecological systems (SES)
                   consisting of two social actors and two ecological
                   resources. The set represents all possible patterns
                   of interdependency in a SES. Each unique motif is
                   characterized in terms of social and ecological
                   connectivity, resource sharing, and resource
                   substitutability. By aligning theoretical insights
                   related to the management of common-pool resources,
                   metapopulation dynamics, and the problem of fit in
                   SES with the set of motifs, we demonstrate the
                   multi-theoretical ability of the framework in a case

  abstract =      {Resource management boundaries seldom align with
                   environmental systems, which can lead to social and
                   ecological problems. Mapping and analyzing how
                   resource management organizations in different areas
                   collaborate can provide vital information to help
                   overcome such misalignment. Few quantitative
                   approaches exist, however, to analyze social
                   collaborations alongside environmental patterns,
                   especially among local and regional organizations
                   (i.e., in multilevel governance settings). This paper
                   develops and applies such an approach using
                   social–ecological network analysis (SENA), which
                   considers relationships among and between social and
                   ecological units. The framework and methods are shown
                   using an estuary restoration case from Puget Sound,
                   United States. Collaboration patterns and quality are
                   analyzed among local and regional organizations
                   working in hydrologically connected areas. These
                   patterns are correlated with restoration
                   practitioners’ assessments of the productivity of
                   their collaborations to inform network theories for
                   natural resource governance. The SENA is also
                   combined with existing ecological data to jointly
                   consider social and ecological restoration concerns.
                   Results show potentially problematic areas in
                   nearshore environments, where collaboration networks
                   measured by density (percentage of possible network
                   connections) and productivity are weakest. Many areas
                   also have high centralization (a few nodes hold the
                   network together), making network cohesion dependent
                   on key organizations. Although centralization and
                   productivity are inversely related, no clear
                   relationship between density and productivity is
                   observed. This research can help practitioners to
                   identify where governance capacity needs
                   strengthening and jointly consider social and
                   ecological concerns. It advances SENA by developing a
                   multilevel approach to assess social–ecological (or
                   social–environmental) misalignments, also known as
                   scale mismatches.},

                   then systematically review one end of this spectrum,

                   future work and would help develop SENs as a unique
                   field of research, not just a method. Authors have
                   studied diverse systems, while mainly focusing on the
                   problem of social-ecological fit alongside a
                   scattering of other topics. There is strong
                   potential, however, to engage other issues central to
                   human-environment studies. Analyzing the simultaneous
                   effects of multiple social, environmental, and
                   coupled processes, change over time, and linking
                   network structures to outcomes are also areas for
                   future advancement. This review provides a
                   comprehensive assessment of (fully articulated) SEN

                   to a unique dataset on industry-level activities in

                   of a province has up to 20 percent more
                   water-polluting activities than otherwise identical

  volume =        {91},

                   social and biophysical context, and collaborative
                   governance responses to interdependent sustainability
                   issues are inherently complex. Governance gaps emerge
                   when responsible actors fail to recognize how
                   multiple issues and actors are interlinked. Closing
                   governance gaps is particularly challenging for
                   sustainability issues that intersect several sectors
                   of society, such as livelihoods, agriculture and
                   biodiversity conservation. This study introduces a
                   new quantitative empirical approach that
                   conceptualizes how governance gaps emerge at the
                   intersection of two networks that are usually studied
                   separately: an actor network and a network of
                   interdependent sustainability issues. We
                   differentiate between (1) integrative gaps that arise
                   when interdependent issues are managed in separation
                   without recognizing their interdependencies, versus
                   (2) collaborative gaps that arise when actors working
                   on common issues do not collaborate. Using data on 60
                   actors and 38 sustainability issues in southwest
                   Ethiopia, we found comprehensive collaboration
                   networks around, for example, agricultural production
                   and land-use issues, but large collaborative gaps for
                   forest and wildlife issues. While actors actively
                   managed interdependencies around national
                   high-priority issues such as coffee export and family
                   planning, integrative gaps were common for
                   low-profile issues such as access provision of
                   finance, transportation, schools, food and crop
                   markets. In general, smaller specialized actors had a
                   stronger tendency than larger generalist actors to
                   focus their management capacity towards the closing
                   of governance gaps. Surprisingly, greater system
                   complexity did not per se cause governance gaps,
                   except when system interactions were cross-sectoral.
                   Furthermore, our data suggested that integrative
                   system management and collaboration reinforced each
                   other. In conclusion, our network framework advances
                   how governance gaps can be understood and prioritized
                   in different empirical contexts. It enables a
                   theoretically informed empirical identification of
                   the specific sustainability issues for which targeted
                   structural changes are most likely to facilitate
                   improved sustainability outcomes.},

                   Barrier Reef Marine Park, 2007–2017) and compared
                   these with the areas of reef features and non-reef
                   marine bioregions. Permission extents were bimodal;
                   72\% were fine scale (median 16.5 km2), and 28\% were
                   broad scale (median 99,193 km2). Biophysical data
                   were unimodal and at significantly smaller scales

                   different activities indicated adaptability within

                   new approach to quantifying scale mismatches. It
                   suggests that discrete institutional scales exist but
                   differ from ecological scales and that rules at
                   broader scales than the managed resource may allow
                   greater adaptation and responsiveness by human users

                   bridge this divide by showing mathematically why
                   complexity makes win–wins elusive. We provide a
                   general proof that increasing the number of
                   objectives, the number of stakeholders or the number
                   of constraints decreases the availability of
                   win–win outcomes (here meaning Pareto
                   improvements). We also show that a measure of
                   tradeoff severity increases in the number of
                   objectives. As the number of objectives approaches
                   infinity, we show that this tradeoff severity measure
                   approaches a limit unaffected by the curvature of the
                   tradeoff surface. This is surprising because concave
                   tradeoff-surface curvature results in less severe
                   tradeoffs with fewer objectives. Our theory suggests
                   that this difference gradually dissipates as
                   objectives are added. In a meta-analysis, we show
                   that 77\% of empirically estimated two-objective
                   tradeoff surfaces are concave. We then show how to
                   approximately extrapolate our tradeoff severity
                   measure to higher numbers of objectives, starting
                   from estimated tradeoffs between fewer objectives.
                   Our results provide modellers with precise intuition
                   into practitioners’ scepticism of win–win
                   narratives and practitioners with guidance for
                   assessing the implications of simple tradeoff
                   models.},

                   provides an important foundation for basinscale water
                   resources management. The Scheme 1987 has been in
                   place for more than 30 years,during which time both
                   the natural environment and the socioeconomics in the
                   Yellow River basin have changed dramatically. Thus
                   there is an urgent need to assess the adaptability of
                   Scheme 1987 in changing environments. We have
                   developed a dynamic differential equation and
                   comprehensive evaluation model to assess water
                   allocation scheme adaptability using power system
                   principles. We have constructed an index system
                   consisting of 20 metrics of
                   sensibility,stability,resistance, and resilience and
                   used our method to assess Scheme 1987 between 1999
                   and 2017. The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter has been
                   used to reveal the adaptability trend. The results
                   show that Scheme 1987 adapted well to the changing
                   environment, with highly adaptable years accounting
                   for more than 63.2\% of the 19-year period.
                   Adaptability increased early,peaking in 2005,and then
                   decreased. The scheme began showing an inability to
                   adapt since 2014. We have identified the major
                   factors influencing the adaptability of Scheme 1987
                   and suggested some adjustments for basin-scale water

                   literature focuses on devising regulations and
                   incentive structures to achieve desirable goals. It
                   often presumes the existence of public infrastructure
                   that actualizes these incentives and regulations
                   through a process loosely referred to as
                   ‘governance.’ In many cases, it is not clear if
                   and how such governance infrastructure can be created
                   and supported. Here, we take a complex systems view
                   in which ‘governance’ is an emergent phenomenon
                   generated by interactions between social, economic,
                   and environmental (both built and natural) factors.
                   We present a framework and formal stylized model to
                   explore under what circumstances stable governance
                   structures may emerge endogenously in coupled
                   infrastructure systems comprising shared natural,
                   social, and built infrastructures of which
                   social-ecological systems are specific examples. The
                   model allows us to derive general conditions for a
                   sustainable coupled infrastructure system in which
                   critical infrastructure (e.g., canals) is provided by
                   a governing entity that enables resource users (e.g.,
                   farmers) to produce outputs from natural
                   infrastructure (e.g., water) to meet their needs
                   while supporting the governing entity.},
