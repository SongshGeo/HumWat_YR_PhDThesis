abstract = {A remarkable exploration of the science, history, and politics of the Anthropocene, one of the most important scientific ideas of our time, from two world-renowned experts ~ ``A relentless reckoning of how we, as a species, got ourselves into the mess we're in today, . . . told with determination and in chiseled, almost literary prose.''\textemdash Christoph Irmscher, Wall Street Journal ~ Meteorites, mega-volcanoes, and plate tectonics\textemdash the old forces of nature\textemdash have transformed Earth for millions of years. They are now joined by a new geological force\textemdash humans. Our actions have driven Earth into a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. For the first time in our home planet's 4.5-billion-year history a single species is increasingly dictating Earth's future. To some the Anthropocene symbolizes a future of superlative control of our environment. To others it is the height of hubris, the illusion of our mastery over nature. Whatever your view, just below the surface of this odd-sounding scientific word, the Anthropocene, is a heady mix of science, philosophy, and politics linked to our deepest fears and utopian visions. Tracing our environmental impacts through time, scientists Simon Lewis and Mark Maslin reveal a new view of human history and a new outlook for the future of humanity in the unstable world we have created.},

Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries-climate change and biosphere integrity-have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.},

abstract = {Addressing the sustainability challenges that humanity is facing in the Anthropocene requires the coupling of human and natural systems, rather than their separate treatment. To help understand the dynamics of a coupled human and natural system (CHANS) and support the design of policies and measures that promote sustainability, we propose a conceptual cascade framework of ``pattern\textendash process\textendash service\textendash sustainability'', which is characterized by coupling landscape patterns and ecological processes, linking ecological processes to ecosystem services, and promoting social\textendash ecological sustainability. The use of this framework is illustrated by a review of CHANS research experience in China's Loess Plateau (LP), a well-known region for its historically severe soil erosion and successful ecological restoration achieved in recent decades. Ecological restoration in the LP has greatly increased its vegetation coverage and controlled its soil erosion. However, some accompanied issues, like soil drying in some areas due to the introduction of exotic plant species and the mismanagement of planted vegetation and water use conflicts between vegetation and humans caused by the trade-off between carbon sequestration and water supply, have started to threaten the long-term sustainability of the LP. Based on a comprehensive understanding of CHANS dynamics, the social\textendash ecological sustainability of the LP can be improved through enhancing water and food security, implementing basin-wide governance, maintaining ecological restoration achievements, and promoting rural livelihood transition. The research experience accumulated on the LP offers examples of the application of the pattern\textendash process\textendash service\textendash sustainability framework. Future research using this framework should especially focus on the integrated research of multiple processes; the cascades of ecosystem structure, function, services, and human well-being; the feedback mechanisms of human and natural systems; and the data and models for sustainability.},

Despite its recent coming of age, the anthropology of water is incredibly expansive. It attends to molecular, embodied, ecosystemic, and planetary issues. I provide an overview of that breadth in four thematic clusters: (in)sufficiency, bodies and beings, knowledge, and ownership. These clusters highlight issues of materiality, ontological politics, and political economy. They are the grounds on which questions of water justice are elucidated. Furthermore, I show how water is always more than itself; its force and material presence constantly frame people's efforts to address the fundamental question of what it means to live life collectively in a world that is always more than human. I close with two directions for research: the denaturalization of water's materiality and the diversification of the moral undertones of our analytic vocabularies.},

abstract = {The emerging field of socio-hydrology is a special case of social-ecological systems research that focuses on coupled human-water systems, exploring how the hydrologic cycle and human cultural traits coevolve and how such coevolutions lead to phenomena of relevance to water security and sustainability. As such, most problems tackled by socio-hydrology involve some aspects of engineering design, such as large-scale water infrastructure, and self-organization in a broad context, such as cultural change at the population level and the hydrologic shift at the river basin or aquifer level. However, within the field of socio-hydrology, it has been difficult to find general theories that assist our understanding of the dynamics emerging from the interplay between design and selforganization, hindering generalization of phenomena between cases. We address this gap by developing insights on how the theoretical frameworks of robustness-fragility trade-off and cultural multilevel selection can inform our understanding in this regard. We apply the two theories to two cases in the Ganges Brahmaputra Delta in Bangladesh and the Kissimmee River Basin in Florida, illustrating how the two theories may provide general insights into causal mechanisms shaping the socio-hydrological phenomena observed in the two cases. Specifically, we use the two theories to address (1) the transference of system fragility across different domains due to design choices and (2) the multilevel social processes in the nested organizational hierarchy that lead to the formation or collapse of shared cultural traits. We show that these two theories, separately or taken together, can provide richer theoretical grounding for understanding socio-hydrological phenomena.},

Increasingly, the scale of human impacts in the Anthropocene is altering the dynamics of this cycle, which presents additional challenges for water governance. ``Earth system law'' provides an important approach for addressing gaps in governance that arise from the mismatch between the global hydrological cycle and dispersed regulatory architecture across institutions and geographic regions. In this article, we articulate the potential for Earth system law to account for core hydrological problems that complicate water governance, including delay, redistribution, intertwinements, permanence, and scale. Through merging concepts from Earth system law with existing policy and legal principles, we frame an approach for addressing hydrological problems in the Anthropocene and strengthening institutional fit between established governance systems and the global hydrological cycle. We discuss how such an approach can be applied, and the challenges and implications for governing water as a cycle and complex social-hydrological system, both in research and practice.},

abstract = {Identifying means of empirically modeling the human component of a coupled, human-water system becomes critically important to further advances in sociohydrology. We develop a social-psychological model of environmental decision making that addresses four key challenges of incorporating social science into integrated models. We use the model to explain preferences for three conservation policies designed to conserve and protect water resources and aquatic ecosystems in the Smoky Hill River Basin, a semiarid agricultural region in the Central U.S. Great Plains. Further, we compare the model's capacity to explain policy preferences among members of two groups in the River Basin: agricultural producers and members of nonfarming communities. We find that financial obligation is the strongest and most consistent explanation of support for conservation policies among members of both groups. We also find that policy support is grounded in cultural values\textemdash deeply held ideas about right and wrong. Environmental values are particularly important explanations of policy support. The constellations of values invoked to make decisions about policies, and the social-psychological pathways linking values to policy support, can vary across policies and types of agents (farmers and nonfarmers). We discuss the implications of the results for future research in sociohydrology.},

abstract = {Freshwater is one of the most critical elements for sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. River basins, concomitant with administrative zones, form a common unit for freshwater management. So far, no comprehensive, global analysis exists that would link the ecological challenges of the planet's river basins to the capacity of the societies to cope with them. We address this gap by performing a geospatial resilience analysis for a global set of 541 river basins. We use the social-ecological systems approach by relating three ecological vulnerability factors (human footprint, natural hazards, and water scarcity) with three adaptive capacity factors (governance, economy, and human development), based on temporal trajectories from 1990 to 2015. Additionally, we examine resilience by subtracting ecological vulnerability from adaptive capacity. The most striking result is the fundamentally different patterns of controlling factors of the resilience in different developing regions, particularly those of Africa and Asia. Their root causes are particularly low adaptive capacity in Africa and high ecological vulnerability in Asia. Alarmingly, the difference between those continents grew within the study period. Finally, this study highlights the rapid dynamics of adaptive capacity in comparison to ecological vulnerability, the latter having more inertia. Their fragile balance is of our interest; they can either support or counteract each other depending on the geographic location. Plain language summary The ongoing global environmental change highlights the critical role of freshwater for sustainable development of ecosystems and human societies. Resilience is the capacity to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing changes. In this study, we perform a spatial analysis for 541 watersheds to identify the drivers of this resilience. We define resilience of each basin by first examining their adaptive capacity, which is a combination of governance, economy, and human development. We then define ecological vulnerability by combining human footprint, natural hazards, and water scarcity into one index. To conclude, resilience indicates the strength of community's adaptive capacity in the presence of ecological vulnerability. Our results indicate the different patterns resilience across the globe, pointing out how the similarly low resilience in Africa and Asia is caused by low adaptive capacity and high ecological vulnerability, respectively. Our temporal analysis 1990\textendash 2015 shows how this difference has been increasing over time. Interestingly, adaptive capacity was more dynamic over time, compared to more constant ecological vulnerability. The examined balance between adaptability and vulnerability provides a useful tool for managing the resilience of freshwater resources.},

abstract = {Humans and water are closely connected in large river basins and form social-ecological systems (SESs). How\- ever, cross-scale effect in SESs make it difficult to identify the key forces driving human-water connections at the community scale when ignoring the landscape context. Focusing on the incongruous human-water relationships in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, we built local resident perception-based networks linking the agri\- cultural subsystem, environmental subsystem, and cultural subsystem by distributing farmer household ques\- tionnaires and extracted 13 indicators from 7 kinds of network metrics to indicate human-water connections. We applied analysis of variance (ANOVA), random forest (RF) and multilevel linear model (MLM) methods to identify the driving forces of perception-based human-water connections among 20 factors at both the com\- munity and landscape scales. The results showed that the perception-based network indicators were mainly directly influenced by community-level driving factors, especially the accessibility of information, such as the frequency of going out, the frequency of accessing the Yellow River channel, and the information source for the national policy on the Yellow River. The influences of community-level driving factors on network indicators were affected by landscape-level driving factors, e.g., the nighttime light, population density, gross domestic product and proportion of artificial land, thus indicating indirect influences from the landscape context. These analyses and findings can enrich the methods by which social, ecological and hydrological elements are structurally linked in socio\- hydrologic research and highlight the cross-scale effect of the landscape context on human-water systems at the community level.},

Nowadays, the human\textendash water relationship in China is disharmonious and the relationship between human activities and water resources has entered into a vicious cycle. This paper concluded that achieving human\textendash water harmony is a necessary and rational pathway to solve China's water problems on the basis of reviewing the development course of CWRM. In order to achieve human\textendash water harmony in China, many impressive efforts both in terms of policies and measures have been made. Ultimately, they pointed out that human\textendash water harmony can be achieved through our tireless efforts as long as people hold the belief that the idea of `human\textendash water harmony' is the first and the foremost way to deal with the contradiction between human activities and water resources.},

abstract = {Abstract. The Millennium Drought lasted more than a decade and is notable for causing persistent shifts in the relationship between rainfall and runoff in many southeastern Australian catchments. Research to date has successfully characterised where and when shifts occurred and explored relationships with potential drivers, but a convincing physical explanation for observed changes in catchment behaviour is still lacking. Originating from a large multi-disciplinary workshop, this paper presents and evaluates a range of hypothesised process explanations of flow response to the Millennium Drought. The hypotheses consider climatic forcing, vegetation, soil moisture dynamics, groundwater, and anthropogenic influence. The hypotheses are assessed against evidence both temporally (e.g. why was the Millennium Drought different to previous droughts?) and spatially (e.g. why did rainfall\textendash runoff relationships shift in some catchments but not in others?). Thus, the strength of this work is a large-scale assessment of hydrologic changes and potential drivers. Of 24 hypotheses, 3 are considered plausible, 10 are considered inconsistent with evidence, and 11 are in a category in between, whereby they are plausible yet with reservations (e.g. applicable in some catchments but not others). The results point to the unprecedented length of the drought as the primary climatic driver, paired with interrelated groundwater processes, including declines in groundwater storage, altered recharge associated with vadose zone expansion, and reduced connection between subsurface and surface water processes. Other causes include increased evaporative demand and harvesting of runoff by small private dams. Finally, we discuss the need for long-term field monitoring, particularly targeting internal catchment processes and subsurface dynamics. We recommend continued investment in the understanding of hydrological shifts, particularly given their relevance to water planning under climate variability and change.},

The history of the pendulum swing for water allocation between the economic development and aquifer environmental health of the system is divided into five eras (i.e., natural, exploitation, degradation and restoration, drought-triggered deterioration, and returning to equilibrium). The system's evolution was interpreted using the Taiji\textendash Tire model. Over-exploitation was considered as the main cause of aquifer depletion, and the groundwater utilization pattern was affected by the varying groundwater table. The aquifer depletion enhanced community sensitivity toward environmental issues, and upgraded the social productive force for restoration. The evolution of the system was substantially impacted by two droughts. The drought in 1965 induced the system from natural conditions to groundwater exploiting. The drought from 1997 to 2002 resulted in a surge in further groundwater abstraction and dramatic aquifer deterioration, and community sensitivity increased rapidly and induced the social productive force to a tipping point. From then on, the system returns to equilibrium through new policies and water-saving technologies. Along with the establishment of a strict water resource management strategy and the launch of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, further restoration of groundwater environment was implemented. However, a comprehensive and coordinated drought management plan should be devised to avoid irreversible change in the system.},

abstract = {Abstract. This paper presents a case study centred on the Murrumbidgee River basin in eastern Australia. It illustrates the dynamics of the balance between water extraction and use for food production, and efforts to mitigate and reverse consequent degradation of the riparian environment. In particular, the paper traces the history of a pendulum swing between an exclusive focus on agricultural development and food production in the initial stages and its attendant socio-economic benefits, followed by the gradual realization of the adverse environmental impacts, subsequent efforts to mitigate these with the use of remedial measures, and ultimately concerted efforts and externally imposed solutions to restore environmental health and ecosystem services. The 100-year history of development within the Murrumbidgee is divided into four eras, each underpinned by the dominance of different values and norms and turning points characterized by their changes. The various stages of development can be characterized by the dominance, in turn, of infrastructure systems, policy frameworks, economic instruments, and technological solutions. The paper argues that, to avoid these costly pendulum swings, management needs to be underpinned by long-term coupled socio-hydrologic system models that explicitly include the two-way coupling between human and hydrological systems, including the slow evolution of human values and norms relating to water and the environment. Such coupled human\textendash water system models can provide insights into dominant controls of the trajectory of their co-evolution in a given system, and can also be used to interpret patterns of co-evolution of such coupled systems in different places across gradients of climatic, socio-economic and socio-cultural conditions, and in this way to help develop generalizable understanding.},

abstract = {Currently the most popular approach in socio hydrology is to develop coupled human\textendash water models. This article proposes an alternative approach, qualitative case study research, involving a systematic review of (1) the human activities affecting the hydrology in the case, (2) the main human actors, and (3) the main factors influencing the actors and their activities. Moreover, this article presents a case study of the Dommel Basin in Belgium and the Netherlands, and compares this with a coupled model of the Kissimmee Basin in Florida. In both basins a ``pendulum swing'' from water resources development and control to protection and restoration can be observed. The Dommel case study moreover points to the importance of institutional and financial arrangements, community values, and broader social, economic, and technical developments. These factors are missing from the Kissimmee model. Generally, case studies can result in a more complete understanding of individual cases than coupled models, and if the cases are selected carefully and compared with previous studies, it is possible to generalize on the basis of them. Case studies also offer more levers for management and facilitate interdisciplinary cooperation. Coupled models, on the other hand, can be used to generate possible explanations of past developments and quantitative scenarios for future developments. The article concludes that, given the limited attention they currently get and their potential benefits, case studies deserve more attention in sociohydrology.},

abstract = {This study is focused on the water-agriculture-environment nexus as it played out in the Murrumbidgee River Basin, eastern Australia, and how coevolution of society and water management actually transpired. Over 100 years of agricultural development the Murrumbidgee Basin experienced a ``pendulum swing'' in terms of water allocation, initially exclusively for agriculture production changing over to reallocation back to the environment. In this paper, we hypothesize that in the competition for water between economic livelihood and environmental wellbeing, economic diversification was the key to swinging community sentiment in favor of environmental protection, and triggering policy action that resulted in more water allocation to the environment. To test this hypothesis, we developed a sociohydrology model to link the dynamics of the whole economy (both agriculture and industry composed of manufacturing and services) to the community's sensitivity toward the environment. Changing community sensitivity influenced how water was allocated and governed and how the agricultural sector grew relative to the industrial sector (composed of manufacturing and services sectors). In this way, we show that economic diversification played a key role in influencing the community's values and preferences with respect to the environment and economic growth. Without diversification, model simulations show that the community would not have been sufficiently sensitive and willing enough to act to restore the environment, highlighting the key role of sectoral transformation in achieving the goal of sustainable agricultural development.},

In this context, this paper aims to develop a conceptual framework for understanding the human-water system from the contradiction and co-evolutionary perspective. In this paper, the three contradiction relationships including those of human-water system, climate change and war condition, productive forces and production relations are analyzed by choosing six proxy indicators, and a set of historical data during 722~B.C.-1911~A.D., in China is used as the case study. Human and water is a co-evolution system as the coefficient of determination (R2) between population and water governance activities is 0.9. Advanced productive forces and production relations play an important role in promoting population growth and water governance activities evidenced by high R2 between any two of them. Generally, the co-evolutionary process of these three contradictions can be divided into three stages: slow development, moderate development and fast development. The conceptual framework developed in this study can be used to analyze the evolution of similar human-water systems in the world. Moreover, further research should be done through the simulation of the form and cycles of the three contradiction relationships.},

abstract = {Water scarcity is a global issue, affecting in excess of four billion people. Interbasin Water Transfer (IBWT) is an established method for increasing water supply by transferring excess water from one catchment to another, water-scarce catchment. The implementation of IBWT peaked in the 1980s and was accompanied by a robust academic debate of its impacts. A recent resurgence in the popularity of IBWT, and particularly the promotion of mega-scale schemes, warrants revisiting this technology. This paper provides an updated review, building on previously published work, but also incorporates learning from schemes developed since the 1980s. We examine the spatial and temporal distribution of schemes and their drivers, review the arguments for and against the implementation of IBWT schemes and examine conceptual models for assessing IBWT schemes. Our analysis suggests that IBWT is growing in popularity as a supply-side solution for water scarcity and is likely to represent a key tool for water managers into the future. However, we argue that IBWT cannot continue to be delivered through current approaches, which prioritise water-centric policies and practices at the expense of social and environmental concerns. We critically examine the Socio-Ecological Systems and Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus models as new conceptual models for conceptualising and assessing IBWT. We conclude that neither model offers a comprehensive solution. Instead, we propose an enhanced WEF model (eWEF) to facilitate a more holistic assessment of how these mega-scale engineering interventions are integrated into water management strategies. The proposed model will help water managers, decision-makers, IBWT funders and communities create more sustainable IBWT schemes.},

Global water stocks and fluxes are estimated empirically and with computer models, but this information is conveyed to policymakers and researchers through water cycle diagrams. Here we compiled a synthesis of the global water cycle, which we compared with 464 water cycle diagrams from around the world. Although human freshwater appropriation now equals half of global river discharge, only 15\% of the water cycle diagrams depicted human interaction with water. Only 2\% of the diagrams showed climate change or water pollution\textemdash two of the central causes of the global water crisis\textemdash which effectively conveys a false sense of water security. A single catchment was depicted in 95\% of the diagrams, which precludes the representation of teleconnections such as ocean\textendash land interactions and continental moisture recycling. These inaccuracies correspond with specific dimensions of water mismanagement, which suggest that flaws in water diagrams reflect and reinforce the misunderstanding of global hydrology by policymakers, researchers and the public. Correct depictions of the water cycle will not solve the global water crisis, but reconceiving this symbol is an important step towards equitable water governance, sustainable development and planetary thinking in the Anthropocene.},

The practical aim is to improve our capability to make predictions of water resources dynamics to support sustainable societal development in a changing environment. The concept implies a focus on hydrological systems as a changing interface between environment and society, whose dynamics are essential to determine water security, human safety and development, and to set priorities for environmental management. The Scientific Decade 2013\textendash 2022 will devise innovative theoretical blueprints for the representation of processes including change and will focus on advanced monitoring and data analysis techniques. Interdisciplinarity will be sought by increased efforts to connect with the socio-economic sciences and geosciences in general.

abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Interactions between humans and the environment are occurring on a scale that has never previously been seen; the scale of human interaction with the water cycle, along with the coupling present between social and hydrological systems, means that decisions that impact water also impact people. Models are often used to assist in decision-making regarding hydrological systems, and so in order for effective decisions to be made regarding water resource management, these interactions and feedbacks should be accounted for in models used to analyse systems in which water and humans interact. This paper reviews literature surrounding aspects of socio-hydrological modelling. It begins with background information regarding the current state of socio-hydrology as a discipline, before covering reasons for modelling and potential applications. Some important concepts that underlie socio-hydrological modelling efforts are then discussed, including ways of viewing socio-hydrological systems, space and time in modelling, complexity, data and model conceptualisation. Several modelling approaches are described, the stages in their development detailed and their applicability to socio-hydrological cases discussed. Gaps in research are then highlighted to guide directions for future research. The review of literature suggests that the nature of socio-hydrological study, being interdisciplinary, focusing on complex interactions between human and natural systems, and dealing with long horizons, is such that modelling will always present a challenge; it is, however, the task of the modeller to use the wide range of tools afforded to them to overcome these challenges as much as possible. The focus in socio-hydrology is on understanding the human\textendash water system in a holistic sense, which differs from the problem solving focus of other water management fields, and as such models in socio-hydrology should be developed with a view to gaining new insight into these dynamics. There is an essential choice that socio-hydrological modellers face in deciding between representing individual system processes or viewing the system from a more abstracted level and modelling it as such; using these different approaches has implications for model development, applicability and the insight that they are capable of giving, and so the decision regarding how to model the system requires thorough consideration of, among other things, the nature of understanding that is sought.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

abstract = {Water resource management involves public investments with long-ranging impacts that traditional prediction approaches cannot address. These are increasingly being critiqued because (1) there is an absence of feedbacks between water and society; (2) the models are created by domain experts who hand them to decision makers to implement; and (3) they fail to account for global forces on local water resources. Socio-hydrological models that explicitly account for feedbacks between water and society at multiple scales and facilitate stakeholder participation can address these concerns. However, they require a fundamental change in how we think about prediction. We suggest that, in the context of long-range predictions, the goal is not scenarios that present a snapshot of the world at some future date, but rather projection of alternative, plausible and co-evolving trajectories of the socio-hydrological system. This will both yield insights into cause\textendash effect relationships and help stakeholders identify safe or desirable operating space.},

abstract = {Irrigation is vital for the sustainability of water-limited agricultural areas. However, higher irrigation efficiency (IE) rarely reduces irrigation water consumption, a paradox well noted in the real world. Resolving this paradox requires rigorous assessment of basin-scale IE, which remains rare. This study holistically analyzed basin-scale IE using the Zhangye Basin (ZB), a typical agricultural area in arid northwestern China, as the testbed. A new basin-scale IE index was proposed that factors in irrigation return flow and groundwater's direct contributions to crop evapotranspiration. A novel approach was also developed to calculate this new index based on integrated ecohydrological modeling. The major study findings for the ZB include the following. First, return flow accounts for approximately 13\% of irrigation water, which creates a difference of 0.1 between the new basin-scale IE index and a traditional field-scale index. Second, although basin-scale IE has notable interannual fluctuation, its multiyear average shows stability, which may be dependent on the basin's physical characteristics. Third, basin-scale IE reflects large spatial heterogeneity and is influenced by the intensity of surface water-groundwater interaction. Finally, under the projected future climate, return flow in the ZB will be enhanced by 3.2\% per decade, and basin-scale IE shows an increasing trend. Overall, rigorous evaluation of basin-scale IE is critical to making heterogeneous policies and developing adaptive management strategies under the changing climate. The integrated modeling approach developed in this study provides a methodological foundation for overcoming misunderstandings about the IE paradox and benefits the reform of the current IE policy agenda.},

Recently, several new socio-hydrologic models have been published that explore these dynamics, and these models offer unique opportunities to better understand these coupled systems and to understand how water problems evolve similarly in different regions. These models also offer challenges, as decisions need to be made by the modeler on trade-offs between generality, precision, and realism. In addition, traditional hydrologic model validation techniques, such as evaluating simulated streamflow, are insufficient, and new techniques must be developed. As socio-hydrology progresses, these models offer a robust, invaluable tool to test hypotheses about the relationships between aspects of coupled human-water systems. They will allow us to explore multiple working hypotheses to greatly expand insights and understanding of coupled socio-hydrologic systems.},

Adaptability is part of resilience. It represents the capacity to adjust responses to changing external drivers and internal processes and thereby allow for development along the current trajectory (stability domain). Transformability is the capacity to cross thresholds into new development trajectories. Transformational change at smaller scales enables resilience at larger scales. The capacity to transform at smaller scales draws on resilience from multiple scales, making use of crises as windows of opportunity for novelty and innovation, and recombining sources of experience and knowledge to navigate social-ecological transitions. Society must seriously consider ways to foster resilience of smaller more manageable SESs that contribute to Earth System resilience and to explore options for deliberate transformation of SESs that threaten Earth System resilience.},

abstract = {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning indicators of impending shifts. A critical question, however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or shoreline development (only gradual restoration is possible). The model represents key features of a broad class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers can only be manipulated gradually management action is needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated, often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is also dependent on developing policy processes that enable society to respond more rapidly to information about impending regime shifts.},

abstract = {Climate variability and land use/cover change have a significant impact on hydrological regimes, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, which have critical water shortage problems. Using the Mann-Kendall's test methodology, trends in hydro-climatic variables including precipitation, temperature, land use, and water balance indicators have been detected during the last 60 years in the Middle Yellow River Basin (MYRB). Generally, the MYRB has become much warmer and drier. Compared with 1980, the land use has also changed - to a small degree by 2000 and to a significant degree by 2015, with an increase in vegetation coverage. There are decreasing trends for streamflow and water resources and a shift in water balance, with less precipitation generating streamflow and more water being evaporated, especially after 2000. The response of water balance to climate change and land use/cover change, and the attribution for streamflow decrease was analyzed in the 10 sub-regions of the MYRB, based on the regionalization of parameter w of Fu's Formula. The results indicate that with an increase of E-0/P (potential evaporation/precipitation) or w, there is an increase of ET/P (evapotranspiration/precipitation) and a decrease of R/P (streamflow/precipitation). But, the increasing rate of ET/P decreases with an increase of E-0/P or w. Based on the "natural period" streamflow of 1956-1979, climate variability accounts for 75.8\% of streamflow decrease in 1980-2000. But in 2001-2016, land use/cover change is the main factor in streamflow decrease, accounting for 75.5\% of the decline. The results are useful for understanding what has happened and what will happen under climate change and land use/cover change, for adaption to future water resources management.},

abstract = {In this paper, we use geoarchaeological and paleoenvironmental data from three localities in the Yellow River Valley, China ? Taosi, Sanyangzhuang, and the Yiluo Valley ? to argue that human activity in the mid- to late-Holocene contributed to large-scale changes in the behavior of the Yellow River and that these changes were of sufficient magnitude to bend the arc of China?s history. Massive anthropogenic landscape transformation from the later Neolithic into the early Dynastic periods, especially in the Chinese Loess Plateau, increased sedimentation in the Yellow River requiring intensive investment in flood control features to protect an ever-growing population. As the Yellow River channel aggraded, channel gradients became increasingly steep, and avulsions occurred with greater frequency and consequence. Flooding reached an apogee in the first decades of the Common Era when a massive avulsion of the Yellow River ca. 14?17 CE caused the river to shift to the south and east of its former channel. This avulsion and the catastrophic flooding that followed triggered the collapse of the Western Han dynasty. The Yellow River ? known as ?China?s Tribulation? ? has been seen as a natural scourge that afflicts the inhabitants of the fertile North China Plain. However, when viewed in an Anthropocene perspective, it is evident that China?s Tribulation largely is the result of human manipulation of the environment.},

abstract = {Sediment in rivers is the dominant material source for ecosystems in lower reaches and estuaries, and it is undergoing large variations globally in recent decades. Though we have knowledge that human activities are greatly affecting land surface ecosystem processes and functions, the relationships between sediment transport regime and the intensifying human activities, are still poorly understood. This study was to investigate the changes of sediment transport regime due to the large-scale ecological restoration in the Middle Yellow River Basin (MYRB). In this study, we examined the change of the sediment rating curves using daily sediment load and streamfiow data from 30 stations during time periods including pre- and post-ecological restoration in this region. We found the pair-relationship of the rating parameters (coefficient and exponent), denoted as coefficient-exponent pair-line, is a critical indicator that can detect the shift of sediment transport regime due to disturbed land surface conditions, though the changed hydrometeorological condition may just influence the absolute values of the rating parameters. Our analysis indicates there was a significant and interesting change of the sediment transport regime in the MYRB characterized by the consistent shift of the coefficient-exponent pair-line, together with an increasing exponent and a decreasing coefficient.This changed sediment transport regime can tell that sediment delivery would become lower for normal discharge conditions but potentially higher for extreme discharge conditions, and this phenomenon seems more distinct in relatively smaller watersheds, suggesting a higher risk of the potential high sediment delivery for extreme rainfall conditions especially for small watersheds. Our study would be informative and valuable to decision makers for sustainable watershed management in the MYRB when considering the changed sediment delivery. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Water shortages have become one of the most severe problems in semi-arid regions throughout the world. Although semi-arid regions have always been dry, human activities and climate change are acerbating the problem. In Chinese Yellow River basin, the river is the major source of freshwater for those living there, and they have long suffered from serious water shortages. However, increasing population and decreasing streamflow are making these shortages more acute. This study seeks to quantify changes in available water in the Yellow River basin over the last 100 years and attempts to determine causes for these changes. To do this, the study evaluated changing trends and regime shifts of streamflow using long term historical records at different hydrological stations in the Yellow River basin over the past century. The results show that annual streamflow has a significant decreasing trends (P {$<$} 0.01) in the mid-lower reaches of the basin. Streamflow decomposition by the breaks for additive seasonal and trend approach suggest that this trend can be decomposed into four distinct annual stages (1919-1933, 1934-1969, 1970-1986 and 1987-2011), while the seasonal component demonstrated an evident regime shift in 1986. This regime shift is mainly related to the construction of large reservoirs in the basin. The flow duration curves illustrate a decrease in the magnitude of streamflow over the last century with a relatively uniform flow regime at all stations. The reconstructed streamflow at Toudaoguai station suggests that agricultural irrigation is predominantly responsible for streamflow reductions between Lanzhou and Toudaoguai stations with approximately 9.1 km(3)/a of water extracted between 1997 and 2006. Meanwhile, a decrease of incoming water from upper reaches and soil and water conservation measures were responsible for the significant decline in annual streamflow at mid-lower reaches station. The result of this paper should be of use for water resources planning, watershed management and climate adaptation as they demonstrate how natural and anthropogenic drivers influence water availability in semi-arid regions.},

abstract = {Runoff and sediment loads have exhibited significant changes over the past six decades in the Yellow River Basin, China. The current study evaluates the changing trends and regime shifts in runoff and sediment loads at both the annual and monthly time scales. The associated spatial and temporal variations are analyzed by a sequential t-test analysis of the regime shifts (STARS) approach and the "breaks for additive seasonal and trend" (BFAST) model using hydrological data at eight stations from the 1950s to 2011. Both runoff and sediment loads exhibit significant declines (p {$<$} 0.05), except in the upper reaches of the river near the Tangnaihai station. The regime shifts detected by the STARS approach are not completely consistent with the results from the BFAST method. In most cases, the regime shifts occurred in 1969 and 1986, due to the construction of large reservoirs. Climate change and other human activities, such as large-scale soil and water conservation measures, can result in abrupt changes in hydrological series at some stations. The trapping effects of reservoirs not only cause regime shifts of runoff and sediment loads, but also adjust their inter-annual and seasonal distributions. Various soil and water conservation measures are responsible for the significant reduction in runoff and sediment loads in the mid-lower reaches of the Yellow River Basin. In addition, water withdrawals from both river runoff and ground water play a critical role in the changing trends in runoff and indirectly alter the sediment loads. The findings provide a good reference for the effective promotion of climate change adaptation, water resources planning and river basin management.},

This paper examines the flow regime shifts, changes in the climatic variables such as precipitation, evaporation, temperature, and crop area in the semi-arid Hailiutu catchment in the middle section of the Yellow River by performing several statistical analyses. The Pettitt test, cumulative sum charts (CUSUM), regime shift index (RSI) method, and harmonic analysis were carried out on annual, monthly, and daily discharges. Four major shifts in the flow regime have been detected in 1968, 1986, 1992 and 2001. Characteristics of the flow regime were analyzed in the five periods: 1957\textendash 1967, 1968\textendash 1985, 1986\textendash 1991, 1992\textendash 2000, and 2001\textendash 2007. From 1957 to 1967, the flow regime reflects quasi natural conditions of the high variability and larger amplitude of 6 months periodic fluctuations. The river peak flow was reduced by the construction of two reservoirs in the period 1968\textendash 1985. In the period of 1986\textendash 1991, the river discharge further decreased due to the combined influence of river diversions and increase of groundwater extractions for irrigation. In the fourth period of 1992\textendash 2000, the river discharge reached lowest flow and variation in corresponding to a large increase in crop area. The flow regime recovered, but not yet to natural status in the fifth period of 2001\textendash 2007. Climatic factors are found not likely responsible for the changes in the flow regime, but the changes in the flow regime are corresponding well to historical land use policy changes.},

  abstract = {The Yellow River Delta (YRD) has been experiencing substantial climatic, hydrological, and anthropogenic stresses, and a sound understanding of the regime shift in its hydroclimate-vegetation system is of fundamental importance for maintaining the health and stability of its regional ecosystems. This study constructs and analyzes a 34-year-dataset (1982-2015) of hydro-climatic variables and satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the YRD. A seasonal-trend decomposition technique based on loess (STL), and a structural change analysis were coupled to detect regime shifts of regional hydroclimate and vegetation in the YRD from 1982 through to 2015. During this period the YRD exhibited a significant warmer-drier-greening trend and experienced four regime shifts of its hydroclimate-vegetation system, with the four shift periods roughly centered in 1989, 1998, 2004, and 2012. Partial correlation analysis revealed that temperature was the dominant factor promoting vegetative growth in spring and autumn (all PNDVI-TEM greater than 0.65), and streamflow impacted the NDVI mainly in summer. Temperature and precipitation were the dominant controls of vegetative growth during the growing season prior to 2002, and thereafter precipitation and streamflow alternately became the main moisture-influencing factors of vegetative growth. Streamflow played an important complementary role on vegetative growth, particularly in near riverine areas when drought exceeds a certain threshold. Additionally, climate shifts determined the changing trend of NDVI across the region, while the effect of land use change is localized and predominant in the northeastern part of the study region. These findings offer an insight into appropriate water regulation of the Yellow River and on climatic adaptation within the YRD.},

This study contributes a diagnostic evaluation framework that pairs exploratory modeling with global sensitivity analysis to enhance our ability to make inferences on water scarcity vulnerabilities in institutionally complex river basins. Diagnostic evaluation of models representing institutionally complex river basins with many stakeholders poses significant challenges. First, it needs to exploit a large and diverse suite of simulations to capture important human-natural system interactions as well as institutionally aware behavioral mechanisms. Second, it needs to have performance metrics that are consequential and draw on decision-relevant model outputs that adequately capture the multisector concerns that emerge from diverse basin stakeholders. We demonstrate the proposed model diagnostic framework by evaluating how potential interactions between changing hydrologic conditions and human demands influence the frequencies and durations of water shortages of varying magnitudes experienced by hundreds of users in a subbasin of the Colorado River. We show that the dominant factors shaping these effects vary both across users and, for an individual user, across percentiles of shortage magnitude. These differences hold even for users sharing diversion locations, demand levels or water right seniority. Our findings underline the importance of detailed institutional representation for such basins, as institutions strongly shape how dominant factors of stakeholder vulnerabilities propagate through the complex network of users.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the hydrological response to an increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change is critical for the proper management of water resources within agricultural systems. This study modeled the hydrological responses to variations of atmospheric CO2 (550 and 970ppm), temperature (+1.1 and +6.4\textdegree C), and precipitation (0\%, {$\pm$}10\%, and {$\pm$}20\%) based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to model the hydrology and impact of climate change in the highly agricultural San Joaquin watershed in California. This watershed has an area of 14,983km2 with a Mediterranean climate, resulting in a strong dependence on irrigation. Model calibration (1992\textendash 1997) and validation (1998\textendash 2005) resulted in Nash\textendash Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.95 and 0.94, respectively, for monthly stream flow. The results of this study suggest that atmospheric CO2, temperature and precipitation change have significant effects on water yield, evapotranspiration, irrigation water use, and stream flow. Increasing CO2 concentration to 970ppm and temperature by 6.4\textdegree C caused watershed-wide average evapotranspiration, averaged over 50 simulated years, to decrease by 37.5\%, resulting in increases of water yield by 36.5\%, and stream flow by 23.5\% compared to the present-day climate. Increasing temperature caused a temporal shift in plant growth patterns and redistributed evapotranspiration and irrigation water demand earlier in the year. This caused an increase in stream flow during the summer months due to decreased irrigation demand. Water yield, however, decreased with an increase in temperature. Increase of precipitation by {$\pm$}10\% and {$\pm$}20\% generally changed water yield and stream flow proportionally, and had negligible effects on predicted evapotranspiration and irrigation water use. Overall, the results indicate that the San Joaquin watershed hydrology is very sensitive to potential future climate changes. Agricultural implications include changes to plant growth rates, irrigation timing and runoff, all of which may affect future water resources and water quality.},

  abstract = {We develop a new large-scale hydrological and water resources model, the Community Water Model (CWatM), which can simulate hydrology both globally and regionally at different resolutions from 30\&thinsp;arcmin to 30\&thinsp;arcsec at daily time steps. CWatM is open source in the Python programming environment and has a modular structure. It uses global, freely available data in the netCDF4 file format for reading, storage, and production of data in a compact way. CWatM includes general surface and groundwater hydrological processes but also takes into account human activities, such as water use and reservoir regulation, by calculating water demands, water use, and return flows. Reservoirs and lakes are included in the model scheme. CWatM is used in the framework of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP), which compares global model outputs. The flexible model structure allows for dynamic interaction with hydro-economic and water quality models for the assessment and evaluation of water management options. Furthermore, the novelty of CWatM is its combination of state-of-the-art hydrological modeling, modular programming, an online user manual and automatic source code documentation, global and regional assessments at different spatial resolutions, and a potential community to add to, change, and expand the open-source project. CWatM also strives to build a community learning environment which is able to freely use an open-source hydrological model and flexible coupling possibilities to other sectoral models, such as energy and agriculture.},

SWIM is a continuous-time semi-distributed ecohydrological model, integrating hydrological processes, vegetation, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and sediment transport at the river basin scale. Its spatial disaggregation scheme has three levels: (1) basin, (2) sub-basins and (3) hydrotopes within sub-basins. The model was extensively tested and validated for hydrological processes, nitrogen dynamics, crop yield and erosion (mainly in mesoscale sub-basins of the German part of the Elbe River basin). After appropriate validation in representative sub-basins, the model can be applied at the regional scale for impact studies. Particular interest in the global change impact studies is given to effects of expected changes in climate and land use on hydrological processes and agro-ecosystems, including water balance components, water quality and crop yield. This paper (a) introduces the reader to the class of process-based ecohydrological catchment scale models, (b) introduces SWIM as one such model, and (c) presents two examples of impact studies performed with SWIM for the federal state of Brandenburg (Germany), which overlaps with the lowland part of the Elbe drainage area. The impact studies provide a better understanding of the complex interactions between climate, hydrological processes and vegetation, and improve our potential adaptation to the expected changes.

Use of these models, however, requires that the representation of processes and key assumptions involved be understood by the user community. This paper provides a full description of process implementation in the most recent version of the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys), a model that has been applied in a wide variety of research settings. An overview of the underlying (Geographic Information System) GIS-based model framework is given followed by a description of the mathematical models used to represent various biogeochemical cycling and hydrologic processes including vertical and lateral hydrologic fluxes, microclimate variability, canopy radiation transfer, vegetation and soil microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling. An example application of RHESSys for a small forested watershed as part of the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Research site is included to illustrate use of the model in exploring spatial-temporal dynamics and the coupling between hydrology and biogeochemical cycling.},

  abstract = {The risk coping culture of a community plays a major role in the development of urban floodplains. In this paper we analyse, in a conceptual way, the interplay of community risk coping culture, flooding damage and economic growth. We particularly focus on three aspects: (i) collective memory, i.e., the capacity of the community to keep risk awareness high; (ii) risk-taking attitude, i.e., the amount of risk the community is collectively willing to be exposed to; and (iii) trust of the community in risk reduction measures. To this end, we use a dynamic model that represents the feedback between the hydrological and social system components. Model results indicate that, on the one hand, by under perceiving the risk of flooding (because of short collective memory and too much trust in flood protection structures) in combination with a high risk-taking attitude, community development is severely limited because of high damages caused by flooding. On the other hand, overestimation of risk (long memory and lack of trust in flood protection structures) leads to lost economic opportunities and recession. There are many scenarios of favourable development resulting from a trade-off between collective memory and trust in risk reduction measures combined with a low to moderate risk-taking attitude. Interestingly, the model gives rise to situations in which the development of the community in the floodplain is path dependent, i.e., the history of flooding may lead to community growth or recession.

  abstract = {Collective memory plays a controlling role in adaptation to potential flood risks, by learning from past disasters. However, with little quantitative empirical data, previous socio-hydrological models have conceptualized the decaying process of flood memory in an oversimple approach. Here, based on survey data of 683 respondents on Ningxia Floodplain, we confirmed that flood memory decays overtime via two channels: oral communication (communicative memory) and physical recording of information (cultural memory). Using the Universal Decay Model (UDM) proposed by previous researchers provides better fitting of results to the decay of flooding memory (adjusted R2 coefficient are 0.97, 0.90, 0.95 when data of all, rural or urban respondents used, respectively) compared with the original exponential model (adjusted R2 coefficient are 0.91, 0.74, 0.59, corresponding). Then, significantly reduced losses for the same flood sequence predicted by integrating the UDM into a sociohydrological model by 16\% and the differences between different clusters (urban and rural respondents) can even reach 22.81\%. These differences suggest that previous socio-hydrological models have been too simplistic in their conceptualizations of decaying processes associated with collective memory, which may have limited deeper insights into flood risk management.},

  abstract = {In flood risk assessment, there remains a lack of analytical frameworks capturing the dynamics emerging from two-way feedbacks between physical and social processes, such as adaptation and levee effect. The former, adaptation effect, relates to the observation that the occurrence of more frequent flooding is often associated with decreasing vulnerability. The latter, levee effect, relates to the observation that the non-occurrence of frequent flooding (possibly caused by flood protection structures, e.g. levees) is often associated to increasing vulnerability. As current analytical frameworks do not capture these dynamics, projections of future flood risk are not realistic. In this paper, we develop a new approach whereby the mutual interactions and continuous feedbacks between floods and societies are explicitly accounted for. Moreover, we show an application of this approach by using a socio-hydrological model to simulate the behavior of two main prototypes of societies: green societies, which cope with flooding by resettling out of flood-prone areas; and technological societies, which deal with flooding also by building levees or dikes. This application shows that the proposed approach is able to capture and explain the aforementioned dynamics (i.e. adaptation and levee effect) and therefore contribute to a better understanding of changes in flood risk, within an iterative process of theory development and empirical research.},

We consider two different types of socio-hydrological systems: green systems, whereby societies deal with risk only via non-structural measures, and technological systems, whereby risk is dealt with also by structural measures, such as levees. A stylized model of human-flood interactions is first compared to real-world data collected at two test sites (People's Republic of Bangladesh and the city of Rome, Italy) and then used to explore plausible trajectories of flood risk. The results show that flood risk in technological systems tends to be significantly lower than in green systems. However, technological systems may undergo catastrophic events, which lead to much higher losses. Furthermore, green systems prove to be more resilient than technological ones, which makes them more capable of withstanding environmental and social changes.},

  abstract = {The ANEMI model is an integrated assessment model of global change that emphasizes the role of water resources. The model is based on the principles of system dynamics simulation to analyze changes in the Earth system using feedback processes. Securing water resources for the future is a key issue of global change, and ties into global systems of population growth, climate change, carbon cycle, hydrologic cycle, economy, energy production, land use and pollution generation. Here the third iteration of the model\textendash ANEMI3 is described, along with the methods used for parameter estimation and model testing. The main differences between ANEMI3 and previous versions include: (i) implementation of the energy-economy system based on the principles of system dynamics simulation; (ii) incorporation of water supply as an additional sector in the global economy that parallels the production of energy; (iii) inclusion of climate change effects on land yield and potentially arable land for food production, and (iv) addition of nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrient cycles as indicators of global water quality, which affect the development of surface water supplies. The model is intended for analyzing long-term global feedbacks which drive global change. Because of this, there are limitations related to the spatial scale that is used. However, the model's simplicity can be considered a strength, as it allows for the driving feedbacks to be more easily identified. The model in its current form allows for a variety of scenarios to be created to address global issues such as climate change from an integrated perspective, or to examine the change in one model sector on Earth system behaviour. The endogenous structure of the model allows for global change to be driven entirely by model structure rather than exogenous inputs. The new additions to the ANEMI3 model are found to capture long term trends associated with global change, while allowing for the development of water supplies to be represented using an integrated approach considering global economy and surface water quality.},

The model was run under two climate changes, two land use changes and four combined change scenarios for near-future period (2020\textendash 2049). The results revealed that projected climate change impacts include an increase in streamflow (maximum increases of 52\% under RCP 2.6 in December and 170\% under RCP 8.5). Projected sediment concentrations under climate change scenarios showed a monthly average decrease of 10\%. For land use change scenarios, agricultural development scenario indicated an opposite direction of changes in orthophosphate (increases in all months with an average increase of 6\% under agricultural development scenario), leading to the conclusion that land use change is the dominant factor in nutrient concentration changes. Combined impacts results indicated that streamflows in late fall and winter months increased while in summer and early fall decreased. Suspended sediment and orthophosphate concentrations were decreased in all months except for increases in suspended sediment concentrations in September and October and orthophosphate concentrations in late winter and early spring due to the impact of land use change scenarios.},

  abstract = {This paper presents and illustrates FlowLogo, an interactive modelling environment for developing coupled agent-based groundwater models (GW-ABMs). It allows users to simulate complex socioenvironmental couplings in groundwater systems, and to explore how desirable patterns of groundwater and social development can emerge from agent behaviours and interactions. GW-ABMs can be developed using a single piece of software, addressing common issues around data transfer and model analyses that arise when linking ABMs to existing groundwater codes. FlowLogo is based on a 2D finitedifference solution of the governing groundwater flow equations and a set of procedures to represent the most common types of stresses and boundary conditions of regional aquifer flow. The platform is illustrated using a synthetic example of an expanding agricultural region that depends on groundwater for irrigation. The implementation and analysis of scenarios from this example highlight the possibility to: (i) deploy agents at multiple scales of decision-making (farmers, waterworks, institutions), (ii) model feedbacks between agent behaviours and groundwater dynamics, and (iii) perform sensitivity and multirealisation analyses on social and physical factors. The FlowLogo interface allows interactively changing parameters using `tuneable' dials, which can adjust agent decisions and policy levers during simulations. This flexibility allows for live interaction with audiences (role-plays), in participatory workshops, public meetings, and as part of learning activities in classrooms. FlowLogo's interactive features and ease of use aim to facilitate the wider dissemination and independent validation of GW-ABMs.},

Although a third of Earth's largest groundwater basins are being depleted by irrigated agriculture2, little is known about the conditions that lead resource users to comply with conservation policies. Here we developed an agent-based model3,4of irrigated agriculture rooted in principles of cooperation5,6and collective action7and grounded on the World Values Survey Wave 6 (n\,=\,90,350). Simulations of three major aquifer systems facing unsustainable demands reveal tipping points where social norms towards groundwater conservation shift abruptly with small changes in cultural values and monitoring and enforcement provisions. These tipping points are amplified by group size and best invoked by engaging a minority of rule followers. Overall, we present a powerful tool for evaluating the contingency of regulatory compliance upon cultural, socioeconomic, institutional and physical conditions, and its susceptibility to change beyond thresholds. Managing these thresholds may help to avoid unsustainable groundwater development, reduce enforcement costs, better account for cultural diversity in transboundary aquifer management and increase community resilience to changes in regional climate. Although we focus on groundwater, our methods and findings apply broadly to other resource management issues.},

  abstract = {Groundwater depletion is arguably one of humanity's greatest sustainability challenges of the 21st century. With Sustainable Development Goals only a decade away, water authorities around the world are in the urgent need for concrete and targeted measures to ensure that communities adhere to groundwater management policies as rapidly and as effectively as possible. In this paper, we combine computational social science, groundwater modelling and empirical data from the World Values Survey to generate future ensembles of hydro-social trajectories under alternative courses of management and social action or inaction. Our simulations shed new light on the role that cultural values can play in shaping the societal trajectories and norms that emerge when resources are either allocated or not sufficiently allocated to monitor compliance, issue fines, engage community leaders, and deter rule-breakers. This study presents a new approach to explore and evaluate the capacity of existing and future management actions to steer groundwater systems towards sustainable trajectories, to forecast the celerity and timing of social transformations at the inter-decadal scale, and to help nations identify the most pertinent management options under institutional, political, social, and/or cultural constraints. The methods presented here are broadly applicable to support strategic decisions that rely on the monitoring, enforcement, and compliance of environmental regulations.},

It is, however, unclear whether a high diversity of social actors analogously increases the capacity of social-ecological systems to maintain the provision of ecosystem services while undergoing socio-economic and climate changes. Here, using an empirically informed agent-based modelling approach, we demonstrate that both the number of actors (actors richness) and the diversity of the abilities and skills that characterize their management capabilities (actors' functional diversity) are key determinants of the resilience of social-ecological systems to global change. A high complementarity of the actors' functional diversity helps to buffer vulnerable mountain systems against socio-economic and climate change. Actors' response diversity can mediate an abrupt shift in the social-ecological system, leading to new trade-offs in ecosystem services. Our results highlight the importance of considering both the diversity and the complementarity of actors' management capabilities to ensure the provision of ecosystem services in the face of uncertain global change.},

  abstract = {As global environmental change continues to accelerate and intensify, science and society are turning to trans\- disciplinary approaches to facilitate transitions to sustainability. Modeling is increasingly used as a technological tool to improve our understanding of social-ecological systems (SES), encourage collaboration and learning, and facilitate decision-making. This study improves our understanding of how SES models are designed and applied to address the rising challenges of global environmental change, using mountains as a representative system. We analyzed 74 peer-reviewed papers describing dynamic models of mountain SES, evaluating them according to characteristics such as the model purpose, data and model type, level of stakeholder involvement, and spatial extent/resolution. Slightly more than half the models in our analysis were participatory, yet only 21.6\% of papers demonstrated any direct outreach to decision makers. We found that SES models tend to under-represent social datasets, with ethnographic data rarely incorporated. Modeling efforts in conditions of higher stakeholder diversity tend to have higher rates of decision support compared to situations where stakeholder diversity is absent or not addressed. We discuss our results through the lens of appropriate technology, drawing on the concepts of boundary objects and scalar devices from Science and Technology Studies. We propose four guiding principles to facilitate the development of SES models as appropriate technology for transdisciplinary applications: (1) increase diversity of stakeholders in SES model design and application for improved collaboration; (2) balance power dynamics among stakeholders by incorporating diverse knowledge and data types; (3) promote flexibility in model design; and (4) bridge gaps in decision support, learning, and communication. Creating SES models that are appropriate tech\- nology for transdisciplinary applications will require advanced planning, increased funding for and attention to the role of diverse data and knowledge, and stronger partnerships across disciplinary divides. Highly contextualized participatory modeling that embraces diversity in both data and actors appears poised to make strong contributions to the world's most pressing environmental challenges.},

  abstract = {Rotational grazing (RG) has attracted much attention as a cornerstone of multifunctional agriculture (MFA) in animal systems, potentially capable of producing a range of goods and services of value to diverse stakeholders in agricultural landscapes and rural communities, as well as broader societal benefits. Despite these benefits, global adoption of MFA has been uneven, with some places seeing active participation, while others have seen limited growth. Recent conceptual models of MFA emphasize the potential for bottom-up processes and linkages among social and environmental systems to promote multifunctionality. Social networks are critical to these explanations but how and why these networks matter is unclear. We investigated fifty-three farms in three states in the United States (New York, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania) and developed a stylized model of social networks and systemic change in the dairy farming system. We found that social networks are important to RG adoption but their impact is contingent on social and spatial factors. Effects of networks on farmer decision making differ according to whether they comprise weak-tie relationships, which bridge across disparate people and organizations, or strong-tie relationships, which are shared by groups in which members are well known to one another. RG adoption is also dependent on features of the social landscape including the number of dairy households, the probability of neighboring farmers sharing strong ties, and the role of space in how networks are formed. The model replicates features of real-world adoption of RG practices in the Eastern US and illustrates pathways toward greater multifunctionality in the dairy landscape. Such models are likely to be of heuristic value in network-focused strategies for agricultural development.},

  abstract = {Due to its role in intercepting and evaporating water, vegetation is a key medium through which catchment water yields can be manipulated and may prove to be an important tool available to managers for mitigating the effects of climatic changes on yields. Understanding of the effects of vegetation on long-term catchment flows is growing, yet incorporation of these effects into hydrological models has typically been empirical and qualitative, or deterministic and quantitative \textendash{} but at the cost of simplicity. Here we present a new ecohydrological model (the Budyko\textendash Choudhury\textendash Porporato, or BCP, model) that is the combination of two pre-existing models. It is simple, quantitative and process-based. As well as accounting for the well established roles played by average precipitation (P) and potential evaporation (Ep) on long-term catchment flows (R), the BCP model also provides estimates of n \textendash{} a catchment-specific model parameter that alters the partitioning of P between R and evaporation \textendash{} which is estimated as a function of plant-available soil water holding capacity ({$\kappa$}), mean storm depth ({$\alpha$}) and effective rooting depth (Ze). After developing this model and testing results at several spatial scales across Australia, we used the model to analyse the sensitivity of R to changes in Ze and {$\alpha$} (as well as P and Ep) in the high yield zones of the Murray-Darling Basin. The model performed well overall at both the coarse spatial scale (i.e., the Basin) and at the finer scales of sub-basin regions and of catchments, capturing {$\sim$}90\% of the observed variability in R. At the regional scale, BCP-modelled R was more or less the same as when a default (constant) value of n was used to model R (that is, n=1.8). This is due to the general aridity of these regions (under such conditions R is insensitive to small variations in n). However, at the catchment scale, use of the BCP model in `wet' catchments (i.e., R{$>$}500mmy-1) increased the accuracy of predictions by approximately 10\% compared to the default (n=1.8) model. Runoff was shown to be highly sensitive to changes in P in the highest yield zones of the Basin, followed by changes in Ze and then in {$\alpha$}. In contrast, across the whole basin \textendash{} which is highly arid \textendash{} the sensitivity of R to changes in Ze and {$\alpha$}, whilst small in absolute terms, are substantial relative to total basin flows. The incorporation of {$\alpha$}, {$\kappa$} and \textendash{} most importantly from a management perspective \textendash{} Ze into the Budyko model provides a simple and transparent tool for aiding the understanding of the long-term ecohydrological behaviour of catchments and assessing the potential hydrological effects of different land management options under a variable climate.},

It is important to find an effective approach for harmonious regulation of the existing conflicts on the basis of the mechanism hidden in the relationship. Using a case analysis of the Yellow River basin, this paper elucidates the complexity of human-water relationship from three aspects, complexity in the human system and the water system, complexity in their coupling, and complexity in their interaction. We examine the interaction process in human-water relationship, and reveal its mechanism based on the interaction of these two components; then, we summarize the issues in the existing human-water relationship observed in the case basin, and present an new idea － using harmonious regulation to improve such relationship. The results of two case studies, ``Yellow River water distribution'' and ``harmony equilibrium between water resources and economy-society development'', show that facing such a complex relationship involved in this basin, we can adopt the theory and method of harmonious control to achieve an optimized water distribution plan that improves the level of its regional harmony and its human-water relationship, thus proving the approach is valid and useful.},

  abstract = {The Yellow River Basin (YRB), the second largest river basin of China, has experienced a booming agriculture over the past decades. But data on variability of and trends in water consumption, pollution and scarcity in the YRB are lacking. We estimate, for the first time, the inter- and intra-annual water footprint (WF) of crop production in the YRB for the period 1961\textendash 2009 and the variation of monthly scarcity of blue water (ground and surface water) for 1978\textendash 2009, by comparing the blue WF of agriculture, industry and households in the basin to the maximum sustainable level. Results show that the average overall green (from rainfall) and blue (from irrigation) WFs of crops in the period 2001\textendash 2009 were 14\% and 37\% larger, respectively, than in the period 1961\textendash 1970. The annual nitrogen- and phosphorus-related grey WFs (water required to assimilate pollutants) of crop production grew by factors of 24 and 36, respectively. The green\textendash blue WF per ton of crop reduced significantly due to improved crop yields, while the grey WF increased because of the growing application of fertilizers. The ratio of blue to green WF increased during the study period resulting from the expansion of irrigated agriculture. In the period 1978\textendash 2009, the annual total blue WFs related to agriculture, industry and households varied between 19\% and 52\% of the basin's natural runoff. The blue WF in the YRB generally peaks around May\textendash July, two months earlier than natural peak runoff. On average, the YRB faced moderate to severe blue water scarcity during seven months (January\textendash July) per year. Even in the wettest month in a wet year, about half of the area of the YRB still suffered severe blue water scarcity, especially in the basin's northern part.},

  abstract = {Analyzing river basins as coupled human and hydrological systems is important to advance our understanding of hydrological processes, and to provide insights into policy design for water resources management. However, assessing spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic characteristics of human-hydrological interactions remains a challenge, and relevant research has been limited by the lack of computationally tractable models that can integrate water management policies, human activities, and hydrological conditions with sufficient temporal and spatial details. In this study, we propose a modeling framework that tightly couples (1) an agent-based model for farmers' decision-making on water use influenced by collective water management policies, and (2) a distributed hydrological model for simulating integrated groundwater-surface water processes with high spatial and temporal resolutions. We apply the modeling framework to the Heihe River Basin, a large semi-arid river basin with intensive agriculture in China. Through various policy portfolio analyses, the model has identified several unique spatial\textendash temporal characteristics of human-hydrological interactions. These include (1) nonlinear relationships between water policies, farmers' decisions on water use, and hydrological conditions, (2) spatially heterogeneous impacts of water policies on farmers' conjunctive groundwater and surface water use, and (3) location-dependent temporal patterns regarding water policies' influences on hydrological processes. It is found that regional hydrogeological conditions (e.g., depth to water table, distance to rivers) are key factors to influence human-hydrological interactions. The modeling results could advance our understanding of the role of human activities in hydrological cycles, and yield insights into the design of location-based policies for river basin management.},

Based on the discussion of its connotation, this study constructed an evaluation model covering five aspects of society, economy, resources, ecology, and culture. Then we used the obstacle diagnosis model to analyze the main obstacle factors of restricting the improvement of HQD level. Finally, 4 future policy scenarios were designed under the system dynamics (SD) model to simulate the variation of the future development in each province along the Yellow River Basin (YRB). The results show that: (1) The level of HQD in the YRB changed dynamically over time, and it has also improved to varying degrees in all provinces. (2) The cultural subsystem hindered the further improvement of the HQD; for the indicator layer, the proportion of cultural industry in GDP is the main obstacle factor for most provinces. (3) Speeding up economic development and increasing ecological protection is the optimal development path of the YRB. Scientific evaluation of the regional HQD status and simulating the development situation under different scenarios can improve the accuracy and efficiency of managers' decision-making.},

To reveal the interaction relationship and degree of interaction among the subsystems of WRCC, this study introduced the PVAR model into the field of water resources carrying capacity for the first time. From the perspectives of water resources, the economy, society, and the ecological environment, this study discussed the dynamic relationship within WRCC. The results show that the water resources subsystem is the core of WRCC; the impulse response functions of the water resources subsystem and the economic and social subsystems conform to the EKC curve hypothesis; there is a positive mutual promotion between the water resources and the ecological environment subsystem; and the four subsystems have the greatest and a positive influence on themselves. The relationship among subsystems verifies the feasibility of dividing the WRCC evaluation framework from the perspectives of water resources, the economy, society, and the ecological environment. And improving the WRCC in the Yellow River Basin requires vigorously promoting the implementation of water-saving policies and coordinating the relationships among subsystems.},

  abstract = {The book examines theories (models) of how systems (those of humans, nature, and combined humannatural systems) function, and attempts to understand those theories and how they can help researchers develop effective institutions and policies for environmental management. The fundamental question this book asks is whether or not it is possible to get beyond seeing environment as a sub-component of social systems, and society as a sub-component of ecological systems, that is, to understand human-environment interactions as their own unique system. After examining the similarities and differences among human and natural systems, as well as the means by which they can be accounted for in theories and models, the book examines five efforts to describe human-natural systems. The point of these efforts is to provide the means of learning about those systems so that they can be managed adaptively. The final section of the book uses case studies to examine the application of integrated theories/models to the real world.},

  abstract = {The world has become increasingly telecoupled through distant flows of information, energy, people, organisms, goods, and matter. Recent advances suggest that telecouplings such as trade and species invasion often generate spillover systems with profound effects. To untangle spillover complexity, we make the first attempt to develop a typology of spillover systems based on six criteria: flows from and to sending and receiving systems, distances from sending and receiving systems, types of spillover effects, sizes of spillover systems, roles of agents in spillover systems, and the origin of spillover systems. Furthermore, we highlight a portfolio of qualitative and quantitative methods for detecting the often-overlooked spillover systems. To effectively govern spillover systems for global sustainability, we propose an overall goal (minimize negative and maximize positive spillover effects) and three general principles (fairness, responsibility, and capability).},
