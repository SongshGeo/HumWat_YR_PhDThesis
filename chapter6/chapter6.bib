	abstract = {In this paper, we argue for a stronger engagement between concepts in affective and social neuroscience on the one hand, and theories from the fields of anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology on the other. Affective and social neuroscience could provide an additional assessment of social theories. We argue that some of the most influential social theories of the last four decades—rational choice theory, behavioral economics, and post-structuralism—contain assumptions that are inconsistent with key findings in affective and social neuroscience. We also show that another approach from the social sciences—plural rationality theory—shows greater compatibility with these findings. We further claim that, in their turn, social theories can strengthen affective and social neuroscience. The former can provide more precise formulations of the social phenomena that neuroscientific models have targeted, can help neuroscientists who build these models become more aware of their social and cultural biases, and can even improve the models themselves. To illustrate, we show how plural rationality theory can be used to further specify and test the somatic marker hypothesis. Thus, we aim to accelerate the much-needed merger of social theories with affective and social neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development of the natural resources that support our current standards of living is arguably one the biggest challenges of the Anthropocene. Institutions and policies alone however cannot guarantee that the right decisions are made. In this chapter, we argue that sound decisions must overcome the ethical dilemmas that experts face when encapsulating hypotheses of the real-world into numerical models. Using groundwater as an example, we show how the so-called complicity ethic may unfold during the process of designing management and policy interventions, and subsequently recommend eight guiding principles (a charter) that can be followed to reduce the likelihood that this complicity ethic takes place. We then introduce The Collaborative Pathway—a mediated modelling activity that synergistically blends the eight guiding principles of our ethics charter into a practical decision-making process. This approach is designed to foster community engagement, to improve the way sectoral risks and trade-offs are evaluated, and to help stakeholders understand what might drive a particular sector towards best- and worst-case outcomes. If done right and with the right tools and strategies, The Collaborative Pathway can become a useful framework to encode ethics, resilience, and sustainability in our decisions relating to the development and protection of any common-pool resource that maintains our humanity.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The streamflow of the Yellow River (YR) is strongly affected by human
activities like irrigation and dam operation. Many attribution studies
have focused on the long-term trends of streamflows, yet the contributions of
these anthropogenic factors to streamflow fluctuations have not been well
quantified with fully mechanistic models. This study aims to (1) demonstrate whether the mechanistic global land surface model ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology
in Dynamic EcosystEms) is
able to simulate the streamflows of this complex rivers with human
activities using a generic parameterization for human activities and (2) preliminarily quantify the roles of irrigation and dam operation in
monthly streamflow fluctuations of the YR from 1982 to 2014 with a newly
developed irrigation module and an offline dam operation model.
Validations with observed streamflows near the outlet of the YR
demonstrated that model performances improved notably with incrementally
considering irrigation (mean square error (MSE) decreased by 56.9 \%) and
dam operation (MSE decreased by another 30.5 \%). Irrigation withdrawals
were found to substantially reduce the river streamflows by approximately
242.8±27.8×108 m3 yr−1 in line with independent
census data (231.4±31.6×108 m3 yr−1). Dam operation
does not change the mean streamflows in our model, but it impacts
streamflow seasonality, more than the seasonal change of precipitation.
By only considering generic operation schemes, our dam model is able to
reproduce the water storage changes of the two large reservoirs,
LongYangXia and LiuJiaXia (correlation coefficient of
∼ 0.9). Moreover, other commonly neglected factors, such as
the large operation contribution from multiple medium/small
reservoirs, the dominance of large irrigation districts for
streamflows (e.g., the Hetao Plateau), and special management policies
during extreme years, are highlighted in this study. Related
processes should be integrated into models to better project future YR water
resources under climate change and optimize adaption strategies.},
