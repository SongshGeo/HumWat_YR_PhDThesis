  abstract = {Social-ecological systems (SES) research offers new theory and evidence to transform sustainable development to better contend with the challenges of the Anthropocene. Four insights from contemporary SES literature on (a) intertwined SES, (b) cross-scale dynamics, (c) systemic tipping points, and (d) transformational change are explored. Based on these insights, shifts in sustainable development practice are suggested to recognize and govern the complex and codeveloping social and ecological aspects of development challenges. The potential susceptibility of SES to nonlinear systemic reconfigurations is highlighted, as well as the opportunities, agency, and capacities required to foster reconfigurative transformations for sustainable development. SES research proposes the need for diverse values and beliefs that are more in tune with the deep, dynamic connections between social and ecological systems to transform development practice and to support capacities to deal with shocks and surprises. From these perspectives, SES research offers new outlooks, practices, and novel opportunity spaces from which to address the challenges of the Anthropocene.},

  abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations Agenda 2030 represent an ambitious blueprint to reduce inequalities globally and achieve a sustainable future for all mankind. Meeting the SDGs for water requires an integrated approach to managing and allocating water resources, by involving all actors and stakeholders, and considering how water resources link different sectors of society. To date, water management practice is dominated by technocratic, scenario-based approaches that may work well in the short term but can result in unintended consequences in the long term due to limited accounting of dynamic feedbacks between the natural, technical, and social dimensions of human-water systems. The discipline of sociohydrology has an important role to play in informing policy by developing a generalizable understanding of phenomena that arise from interactions between water and human systems. To explain these phenomena, sociohydrology must address several scientific challenges to strengthen the field and broaden its scope. These include engagement with social scientists to accommodate social heterogeneity, power relations, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases, which strongly influence the way in which people alter, and adapt to, changing hydrological regimes. It also requires development of new methods to formulate and test alternative hypotheses for the explanation of emergent phenomena generated by feedbacks between water and society. Advancing sociohydrology in these ways therefore represents a major contribution toward meeting the targets set by the SDGs, the societal grand challenge of our time. Plain Language Summary Water crises that humanity faces are increasingly connected and are growing in complexity. As such, they require a more integrated approach in managing water resources, which involves all actors and stakeholders and considers how water resources link different sectors of society. Yet, water management practice is still dominated by technocratic approaches, which emphasize technical solutions. While these approaches may work in the short-term, they often result in unintended consequences in the long-term. Sociohydrology is developing a generalizable understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between natural,technical and social processes, which can improve water management practice. As such, advancing sociohydrology can contribute to address the global water crises and meet the water-related targets defined by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.},

The consequences of human water-cycle modifications can be non-linear, delayed, and distributed across boundaries, sectors, and scale. This complexity renders freshwater challenges difficult to govern and manage. We here propose a framework for understanding water's many functions for supporting, regulating, and stabilizing hydro-climatic, hydro-ecological, and hydro-social systems. This framework recognizes human impacts on major partitioning points, interactions among water functions, and stabilization and destabilization processes. A functional understanding of the freshwater cycle can integrate with social-ecological resilience-building principles, complement existing water sustainability governance approaches, and highlight the potential need for Earth-system-level governance of water. Recognizing water's diverse functional roles for resilience may promote a new generation of holistic and integrative water-land-climate governance.},

In recent decades, the Yellow River basin is facing a spectacular economic boom, but mainly achieved at the expenses of the environment by over-exploiting the natural resources provided within the basin, which causes various challenges on ecology and society. Water scarcity, pollution, and ecosystem degradation accompanied with biodiversity decline have been further aggravated by anthropogenic-induced climate change. To address the pressing socio-ecological challenges, various conservation and management plans and strategies have been issued, often consulted by international bodies. This article is a comprehensive overview of the current state and recent developments that have occurred in the Yellow River basin and presents and discusses current and pressing socio-ecological challenges.

We provide a perspective of processes unfolding over time to identify the regime shifts of a SES based on changes in the relationships between SES components while also addressing their drivers and local and spillover effects. The applicability of this approach has been demonstrated by analyzing the evolution over the past 1000 years of the SES in China's Loess Plateau (LP). Five evolutionary phases were identified: "fast expansion of cultivation," "slow expansion of cultivation," "landscape engineering for higher production," "transition from cultivation to ecological conservation," and "revegetation for environment." Our study establishes empirical links between the state (phase) of a SES to its drivers and effects. Lessons of single-goal driven and locally focused SES management in the LP, which did not consider these links, have important implications to long-term planning and policy formulation of SES.},

However, impacts of hydrological change on social and ecological systems are infrequently evaluated together at the global scale. Here, we focus on the potential for social and ecological impacts from freshwater stress and storage loss. We find basins with existing freshwater stress are drying (losing storage) disproportionately, exacerbating the challenges facing the water stressed versus non-stressed basins of the world. We map the global gradient in social-ecological vulnerability to freshwater stress and storage loss and identify hotspot basins for prioritization (               n               \,=\,168). These most-vulnerable basins encompass over 1.5 billion people, 17\% of global food crop production, 13\% of global gross domestic product, and hundreds of significant wetlands. There are thus substantial social and ecological benefits to reducing vulnerability in hotspot basins, which can be achieved through hydro-diplomacy, social adaptive capacity building, and integrated water resources management practices.},

The water footprint, which considers water use in supply chains, provides a powerful tool for assessing the contributions of water resources within a certain region by tracking the volume and structure of virtual water flows. In this study of the structure of the water footprint network from a complexity perspective, we reassessed the significance of water resources for crop services in a large river basin with a severe water shortage \textendash{} the Yellow River basin (YRB) of China. The temporal increase of the complexity index indicated that the virtual water outflows (VWFs) from the YRB were becoming increasingly critical to China; i.e. the ability of YRB to produce crops boosted the difficulty of its water being replaced by water exporting from other basins. Decomposition of complexity suggested that during the 1980s to 2000s, the temporally increased complexity was due mainly to the lack of competitors and the increasing uniqueness of crops supporting VWFs. This complexity deeply embedded the YRB into the footprints of a water network that facilitated further development with constrained water resources. Still, it also reinforced reliance from other regions on YRB's scarce water. Based on this analysis, we suggest that resource regulation should be carried out appropriately to ensure ecological sustainability and high-quality development of river basins.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Using a framework developed by Turton, and a common set of characteristics describing key stages of water demand, we examine the effectiveness of isolated technical (e.g., irrigation upgrades) and allocative (e.g., buyback) efficiency for reducing water demand to sustainable levels. We base our analysis on Australia's water reform context which offers an advanced example of applying these levers to achieve allocative and technical efficiency. The study is motivated by appreciation of the benefits from increased policy flexibility and adaptability in response to the following: potential transformations toward inflexible production systems; uncertainty associated with impacts of climate change on future water reliability; and the need for increased possible future equity between uses/users (productive/consumptive, environmental, cultural). Our results highlight that a balance between technical and allocative efficiency mechanisms is necessary, as neither is sufficient in isolation, when seeking to reduce total water use. This approach also enables a clearer representation of uncertainty in future policy choices in many global settings with respect to water demand reduction.},

The capacity of social-ecological systems to deal with shocks, adapting to changing conditions and transforming in situations of crisis are fundamentally dependent on the functions of water to e.g., regulate the Earth's climate, support biomass production, and supply water resources for human societies. However, massive, inter-connected, human interference involving climate forcing, water withdrawal, dam constructions, and land-use change have significantly disturbed these water functions and induced regime shifts in social-ecological systems. In many cases, changes in core water functions have pushed systems beyond tipping points and led to fundamental shifts in system feedback. Examples of such transgressions, where water has played a critical role, are collapse of aquatic systems beyond water quality and quantity thresholds, desertification due to soil and ecosystem degradation, and tropical forest dieback associated with self-amplifying moisture and carbon feedbacks. Here, we aggregate the volumes and flows of water involved in water functions globally, and review the evidence of freshwater related linear collapse and non-linear tipping points in ecological and social systems through the lens of resilience theory. Based on the literature review, we synthesize the role of water in mediating different types of ecosystem regime shifts, and generalize the process by which life support systems are at risk of collapsing due to loss of water functions. We conclude that water plays a fundamental role in providing social-ecological resilience, and suggest that further research is needed to understand how the erosion of water resilience at local and regional scale may potentially interact, cascade, or amplify through the complex, globally hyper-connected networks of the Anthropocene.},

                   governance requires collaboration. However, studies
                   have shown that various types of stakeholders often
                   lack the willingness to deliberate and contribute to
                   jointly negotiated solutions to common environmental
                   problems. Bodin reviews studies and cases that

                   BACKGROUNDCurrent and future generations are
                   confronted with the complex task of devising
                   sustainable solutions to environmental problems. The
                   coming decade might determine whether humanity will
                   be able to set a course toward a future of continued
                   prosperity on a planet whose ecosystems will deliver
                   the needed goods and services. A crucial piece of
                   this puzzle is achieving effective collaboration
                   among different public and private actors and
                   stakeholders. Calls for solving environmental
                   problems through collaborative governance emphasize
                   benefits from local to global scales—from artisanal
                   fishermen avoiding the overfishing of local fish
                   stocks by together agreeing upon sustainable
                   practices, to states jointly committing to implement
                   adequate measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
                   Although commonly advocated, achieving successful
                   collaborations when confronted with complex
                   environmental problems spanning geographical scales
                   and jurisdictional boundaries is an area where
                   substantial knowledge gaps remain. ADVANCESA growing
                   amount of empirical evidence shows the effectiveness
                   of actors engaged in different collaborative
                   governance arrangements in addressing environmental
                   problems. However, studies also show that actors
                   sometimes collaborate only as a means of advocating
                   their own interests, while largely lacking a
                   willingness to contribute towards jointly negotiated
                   solutions to common problems. Hence, collaboration is
                   sometimes unable to deliver any tangible outcomes, or
                   merely produces symbolic outcomes such as aggregated
                   wish lists where conflicts of interest are left
                   untouched.Clearly, no single blueprint exists for how
                   to succeed by using collaborative approaches to solve
                   environmental problems. One way of approaching this
                   puzzle is through the lenses of the participating
                   actors and the ways in which they engage in
                   collaboration with each other. This approach entails
                   directing attention to who the actors are, what their
                   interests and motives are, who they collaborate with,
                   and how the structures of such “collaborative
                   networks” relate to the actors’ joint abilities
                   to address different environmental problems.Emerging
                   insights from recent research suggest that the
                   effectiveness of different collaborative network
                   structures in addressing environmental problems
                   depends on how those problems unfold with respect to
                   the following characteristics: (i) varying levels of
                   risk that actors free-ride on others’ efforts; (ii)
                   varying levels of knowledge gaps, signifying
                   different needs for social learning and deliberation
                   among actors with different backgrounds, experiences,
                   and interests; and (iii) whether these problems are,
                   for all practical purposes, permanent or just
                   temporary.Also, long-standing research questions
                   regarding whether governance structures that are
                   adequately aligned with ecosystem structures and
                   processes are more effective have recently been
                   addressed empirically. Early results suggest several
                   ways in which misalignments between the structure of
                   a collaborative network and the biophysical
                   environment reduce the ability to address
                   environmental problems effectively. OUTLOOKA more
                   nuanced understanding of whether collaborative
                   governance is the most effective way of solving
                   environmental problems is needed. The capacity of
                   collaborative governance to deliver sustainable
                   solutions for any given environmental problem ranges
                   from highly effective to essentially worthless.
                   Future efforts must establish which factors determine
                   the exact location of any collaborative arrangement
                   on this continuum.Emerging insights suggest that
                   where a collaborative arrangement falls on the
                   spectrum results from a complex interplay between
                   several factors. The characteristics of the
                   underlying collective action problem are one factor.
                   Others are the characteristics of the underlying
                   biophysical system and how these align with the ways
                   in which collaborative governance arrangements are
                   constructed, institutionally embedded, and managed.
                   Finally, the patterns in which actors collaborate
                   with each other (or do not) is a factor that
                   potentially determines the effects that the other
                   factors have on a collaborative arrangement’s
                   ability to solve environmental problems. {$<$}img

  ecosystems is challenging because of the high number of stakeholders, the
  permeability of man-made political and jurisdictional demarcations in
  relation to the temporal and spatial extent of biophysical processes, and a
  limited understanding of complex ecosystem and societal dynamics. Given these
  conditions, collaborative governance is commonly put forward as the preferred
  means of addressing environmental problems. Under this paradigm, a deeper
  understanding of if, when, and how collaboration is effective, and when other
  means of addressing environmental problems are better suited, is needed.
  Interdisciplinary research on collaborative networks demonstrates that which
  actors get involved, with whom they collaborate, and in what ways they are
  tied to the structures of the ecosystems have profound implications on
  actors’ abilities to address different types of environmental problems.},

However, the planetary boundary for human freshwater use has been critiqued as a singular measure that does not reflect all types of human interference with the complex global water cycle and Earth System. We suggest that the water planetary boundary will be more scientifically robust and more useful in decision-making frameworks if it is redesigned to consider more specifically how climate and living ecosystems respond to changes in the different forms of water on Earth: atmospheric water, frozen water, groundwater, soil moisture, and surface water. This paper provides an ambitious scientific road map to define a new water planetary boundary consisting of sub-boundaries that account for a variety of changes to the water cycle.},

Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},

  abstract =      {Resource management boundaries seldom align with
                   environmental systems, which can lead to social and
                   ecological problems. Mapping and analyzing how
                   resource management organizations in different areas
                   collaborate can provide vital information to help
                   overcome such misalignment. Few quantitative
                   approaches exist, however, to analyze social
                   collaborations alongside environmental patterns,
                   especially among local and regional organizations
                   (i.e., in multilevel governance settings). This paper
                   develops and applies such an approach using
                   social–ecological network analysis (SENA), which
                   considers relationships among and between social and
                   ecological units. The framework and methods are shown
                   using an estuary restoration case from Puget Sound,
                   United States. Collaboration patterns and quality are
                   analyzed among local and regional organizations
                   working in hydrologically connected areas. These
                   patterns are correlated with restoration
                   practitioners’ assessments of the productivity of
                   their collaborations to inform network theories for
                   natural resource governance. The SENA is also
                   combined with existing ecological data to jointly
                   consider social and ecological restoration concerns.
                   Results show potentially problematic areas in
                   nearshore environments, where collaboration networks
                   measured by density (percentage of possible network
                   connections) and productivity are weakest. Many areas
                   also have high centralization (a few nodes hold the
                   network together), making network cohesion dependent
                   on key organizations. Although centralization and
                   productivity are inversely related, no clear
                   relationship between density and productivity is
                   observed. This research can help practitioners to
                   identify where governance capacity needs
                   strengthening and jointly consider social and
                   ecological concerns. It advances SENA by developing a
                   multilevel approach to assess social–ecological (or
                   social–environmental) misalignments, also known as
                   scale mismatches.},
